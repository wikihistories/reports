title: "Reports"
---

This site hosts the annual reports of the [wikihistories](https://wikihistories.net) project. Each report considers a different aspect of Australian history in Wikipedia. The reports partly inform national debate about the nature of Australia's past, but they also speak to a global audience, as examples of how we can interrogate Wikipedia to uncover the historiography of the world's largest knowledge system.

In 2023, we consider **people**. [Who Counts as Australian?](who-counts.html) uses a dataset of more than 80,000 Wikipedia biographies to reveal what kinds of people represent 'Australia' in the encyclopaedia.

In 2024, we consider **places**. `Where Counts as Australian?` will consider how the world's only continent-sized country makes its way into the world's only planet-sized encyclopaedia.

In 2025, we consider **events**. `When Counts as Australian?` will range over 60,000 years of human history in Australia, revealing which structures, conjunctures and events emerge from deep time to take their place in the encyclopaedia.

These reports primarily fulfil Objectives 2 and 3 of the `wikihistories` project:

**Objective 2:** Map the scope of entries relating to Australian historic events on Wikipedia in order to analyse who and what is systematically omitted.

**Objective 3:** Investigate how Wikipedia’s representations are constructed through practice.
