Who counts as Australian in Wikipedia and its sister-projects? How does Wikipedia portray Australia's population? These questions are easy to ask but hard to answer, because of Wikipedia's *representational multiplicity*. Wikipedia represents Australia in many ways. Its sister projects—Wikidata and Wikimedia Commons preminent among them—represent Australia in myriad other ways.

In this report, we consider several ways that Australians are represented in Wikipedia and Wikidata. More specifically, we focus on how *individual* Australians are represented, in the form of biographical articles (Wikipedia) or 'items' (Wikidata). Our analysis unfolds in three main sections. In [Data], we explain how we built our datasets for analysis: by leveraging Wikipedia's category system, and Wikidata's query engine. In [#who-counts-1-properties], we consider the various ways that a person can be marked as 'Australian' in Wikidata. In [#who-counts-2-quality], we use article quality statistics from XTools to explore how Wikipedia and its users divide their attention between different kinds of Australians. In [Conclusion: beyond bias], we make some suggestions about how Wikipedians might like to improve the representation of Australians in the encyclopaedia. As well as addressing the traditional problem of 'systemic bias', we suggest that Wikipedians draw attention to the *representational multiplicity* of Wikipedia, so that visitors to the site can become more aware of the multiple definitions of 'Australianness' across the Wikiverse.

## Data

### Wikipedia: The category system

The second answer Wikipedia gives to the question, 'Who counts as Australian?' is: everyone who falls under [Category:Australian people](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Australian_people). There are nearly 100,000 articles on English Wikipedia that relate to Australian people, and the number is growing consistently (@fig-included-in-ozpeople-over-time).[^2]

[^2]: The growth was calculated using the `timestamp` data returned by [API:Categorymembers](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/API:Categorymembers). The `timestamp` records when an article, file or subcategory was included in a given category. The documentation does not explain how the inclusion time is calculated for pages that are removed from and then re-included in a category. If an article was included in multiple subcategories of Category:Australian people, then the earliest timestamp was used to calculate its position in the figure.

```{r}
#| label: fig-included-in-ozpeople-over-time
#| fig-cap: Category:Australian people has grown consistently since the early days of Wikipedia
australians$nodes %>% 
  filter(ns == 0) %>%
  left_join(australians$edges, by = join_by(pageid == target)) %>% 
  mutate(included = as_datetime(timestamp)) %>% 
  arrange(pageid, included) %>% 
  group_by(pageid) %>% 
  slice(1) %>% 
  ungroup() %>% 
  mutate(included = round_date(included, "day")) %>% 
  count(included) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(included, cumsum(n))) +
  geom_line() +
  labs(x = "Time (days)", y = "Cumulative number of articles")
```
```{r}
category_graph <- graph_from_data_frame(
  d = australians$edges %>% 
    left_join(australians$nodes, join_by(target == pageid)) %>% 
    filter(ns == 14) %>% 
    select(source:timestamp),
  directed = TRUE,
  vertices = australians$nodes %>% filter(ns == 14)
)

vertex_by_id <- function(graph, pageid) {
  V(graph)[V(graph)$name %in% pageid]
}

root <- V(category_graph)[[1]]

category_url <- function(category, collapse = " → ") {
  paste0("[", category, "](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/", category, ")", collapse = collapse)
}
```

When editors include articles in `Category:Australian people`, they do not necessarily do so intentionally. Category:Australian people is the root node of a vast tree-like [graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_(discrete_mathematics)) of categories. The editor who categorised [Steve Wozniak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Wozniak) as a [staff member of the University of Technology Sydney](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Academic_staff_of_the_University_of_Technology_Sydney) was probably unaware that they were thereby categorising Wozniak as an 'Australian person'. The category for academic staff at UTS lies several layers deep in the category graph, `r distances(category_graph, root, vertex_by_id(category_graph, 32435264))` steps away from the root: `r shortest_paths(category_graph, root, vertex_by_id(category_graph, 32435264))$vpath[[1]]$title %>% rev() %>% category_url()`. Perhaps an editor may quibble that a person who works at UTS is not necessarily 'from Sydney', but in the present state of the category graph, there is no other way to mark a staff member of UTS. The category graph is strictly hierarchical. A subcategory cannot be removed from its parent category for the sake of a single page.

```{r}
full_graph <- graph_from_data_frame(
  d = australians$edges,
  directed = T,
  vertices = australians$nodes
)

# These are the distances from the *article* to the root category. To get the
# weighted distance of the subcategories to the root, take mean(article_distances)
# and subtract one.
article_distances <- distances(
    full_graph,
    v = V(full_graph)[[1]], 
    to = V(full_graph)[V(full_graph)$name %in% filter(australians$nodes, ns == 0)$pageid]
    )
```

Category:Australian people has `r length(category_graph) %>% prettyNum(",")` subcategories, many of which are even farther from the root than the staff of UTS. We can get a sense of how vast this structure is by taking [diameter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distance_(graph_theory)#Related_concepts) of the category graph. In this case, the diameter is `r diameter(category_graph)`, which means that the most distant subcategory of `Category:Australian people` is `r diameter(category_graph)` steps away. Such distant nodes are called 'eccentric' in graph theory. In this case, the most distant subcategory truly is eccentric: `r farthest_vertices(category_graph)$vertices$title[[2]] %>% category_url()` does not include articles about 'Australian people' at all, but about indie rock records. This case is extreme. The case of UTS staffmembers is more typical. If we consider all the articles that have been placed in `Category:Australian people` or its subcategories, we find that the subcategories used are on average `r (mean(article_distances) - 1) %>% round(2)` steps away from the root, with a standard deviation of `r sd(article_distances) %>% round(2)`. In the typical case, when an editor adds an article to an 'Australian people' subcategory, the subcategory is 2-4 steps away from the root. It seems likely that editors are mostly unaware of the category graph as a whole. Editors work locally, trying to find the best categorisations for their articles, while Wikipedia's systems work globally, enforcing the hierarchical logic of the enormous and usually invisible category graph.

If `Category:Australian people` can include articles about indie rock albums, then the question arises: How many of the articles are actually biographies of people connected to Australia? If we can isolate these articles, then more detailed questions become possible: How are different kinds of people represented among Wikipedia's 'Australian' biographies? Wikipedia itself does not clearly distinguish biographies from other kinds of article. To answer this question, we turn to its sister-project, Wikidata.

### Wikidata: The query engine

To build a picture of the Australian *people* in Wikipedia, we queried Wikidata in two different ways.

1. We queried Wikidata for items representing Australian people
2. We fetched the Wikidata item for each article in `Category:Australian people`, and checked to see if the item was labelled 'human' in Wikidata

It turns out that these two approaches return different sets of people, as we explain below. There are many people who have Wikipedia articles in `Category:Australian people` who are not clearly marked as 'Australian' in Wikidata. Likewise, there are many people who are marked as 'Australian' in Wikidata, but who lack a Wikipedia article in `Category:Australian people`. 

Wikidata clearly distinguishes humans from other kinds of entity. Wikidata is made up of *items* and *properties*. To describe the properties of an item, users insert *statements* into the database. Item [Q5](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5) represents the concept 'human'. To mark another item as a human, it must be given the property [P31](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Property:P31), 'instance of' with the value 'Q5'. So, for example, we can see that [Q1064745](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1064745), the poet Charles Harpur, is a human because he has the property P31(Q5), 'instance of: human'. While there are of course many gaps in Wikidata, and in theory there could be human 'items' that lack P31(Q5), it seems that Wikidata's contributors do a good job maintaining this part of the database. There are more than [10 million explicitly-marked humans](https://w.wiki/3c2J) in Wikidata, and it seems unlikely that many notable Australians have had their humanity overlooked by the system.

As a first step, we queried Wikidata to find all humans that were marked as 'Australian' in some way. Humans can be marked as Australian in two main ways on Wikidata:

1. They can be explicitly linked to Australia ([Q408](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q408)) through properties such as citizenship ([P27](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Property:P27)), place of birth ([P19](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Property:P19)) or place of death ([P570](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Property:P570)); or
2. They can be implicitly linked to Australia by being linked to a known database of Australians, such as the Dictionary of Australian Biography ([P1907](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Property:P1907)), Indigenous Australia ([P9246](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Property:P9246)), or Convict Records of Australia ([P9919](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Property:P9919))

We queried Wikidata by `r wikidata_australians$source %>% unique() %>% length()` properties that denote Australianness. Together, these properties are linked to `r wikidata_australians$person %>% unique() %>% length()` unique humans in the database.

```{r}
combined_data <- wikidata_australians %>% 
  nest(source = source) %>% 
  full_join(filter(australians$nodes, ns == 0), by = "title")

overlap_data <- combined_data %>% 
  transmute(
    title = title,
    in_wikidata_set = !is.na(person),
    in_wikipedia_set = !is.na(pageid)
  ) %>% 
  count(in_wikidata_set, in_wikipedia_set)
```

The Wikidata dataset and the Wikipedia dataset do not perfectly overlap. There are `r overlap_data %>% filter(!in_wikipedia_set, in_wikidata_set) %>% pull(n) %>% prettyNum(",")` people we found in our queries to Wikidata who lack a Wikipedia article in `Category:Australian People`. Likewise, there are `r overlap_data %>% filter(in_wikipedia_set, !in_wikidata_set) %>% pull(n) %>% prettyNum(",")` articles in `Category:Australian people` which did not turn up when we queried Wikidata. Of course, many of these `r overlap_data %>% filter(in_wikipedia_set, !in_wikidata_set) %>% pull(n) %>% prettyNum(",")` articles do not represent individual people. We have already seen that one of the articles represents a compilation album by the Melbourne band Custard. There are also many lists, general articles about groups of people and other miscellaneous articles in `Category:Australian people`. How can the datasets be compared?

```{r}
get_wikibase_item <- function(pageid) {
  wiki_action_request() %>% 
    query_by_pageid(pageid) %>% 
    query_page_properties("pageprops", ppprop = "wikibase_item", pplimit = 50) %>% 
    retrieve_all()
}

if (USE_CACHE == FALSE) {
  australians_wikidata_items <- map(
    split(australians$nodes$pageid, seq_along(australians$nodes$pageid) %/% 50),
    get_wikibase_item,
    .progress = T
  ) %>%
    bind_rows() %>% 
    write_csv(file.path(data_dir, "australians-wikidata-items.csv"))
} else {
  australians_wikidata_items <- read_csv(file.path(data_dir, "australians-wikidata-items.csv"))
}

# See scripts/check-if-human.R
load_biography_data <- function() {
  data_files <- list.files(data_dir)
  which_biography <- str_detect(data_files, "category-australia-biographies")
  biography_tbl <- data_files[which_biography] %>%
    file.path(data_dir, .) %>% 
    map(read_csv) %>% 
    bind_rows()
  biography_tbl
}

combined_data <- load_biography_data() %>% 
  select(pageid, biography) %>% 
  right_join(combined_data, by = "pageid") %>% 
  mutate(biography = biography | !is.na(person))
```

To make the datasets comparable, we filtered out non-biographies from the Wikipedia dataset. To do this, we retrieved the Wikidata item for each Wikipedia article, and checked if it had property P31(Q5), 'instance of: human'. This left `r filter(combined_data, biography & !is.na(pageid)) %>% nrow() %>% prettyNum(",")` Wikipedia articles from `Category:Australian people` which we were confident are biographies. These biographies overlap substantially, but not perfectly, with the set of people we found on Wikidata by querying Australian properties (@fig-biography-overlap-table).

```{r}
#| label: fig-biography-overlap-table
#| fig-cap: There is substantial, but incomplete overlap between the biographies in the two datasets
bio_overlap <- combined_data %>% 
  filter(biography) %>% 
  transmute(
    title = title,
    in_wikidata_set = !is.na(person),
    in_wikipedia_set = !is.na(pageid)
  ) %>% 
  count(in_wikidata_set, in_wikipedia_set)

bio_overlap %>% 
  pivot_wider(
    names_from = in_wikidata_set:in_wikidata_set,
    values_from = n
  ) %>%
  select(1,3,2) %>% 
  rename(`In Wikipedia Set?` = in_wikipedia_set) %>%  
  knitr::kable() %>% 
  kableExtra::add_header_above(
    c(" " = 1, "In Wikidata set?" = 2)
  ) %>% 
  kableExtra::kable_styling("striped")
```

## Who Counts (1)? Properties

We have seen how difficult it is to judge whether someone is 'Australian'. This difficulty has two sides: **space** and **time**.

In **space**, it is difficult to judge whether a person is close enough to Australia to count as Australian. At one end is someone who is born, lives and dies in Australia, such as [Oodgeroo Noonuccal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oodgeroo_Noonuccal). At the other end of the spectrum is someone who has only a passing cultural or economic connection to Australia, such as [Steve Wozniak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Wozniak).

In **time**, it is difficult to judge when in history it becomes reasonable to describe someone as 'Australian'. The term 'Terra Australis' ('Southern Land') was coined in the 16th century, before Europeans knew about either Australia or Antarctica. In the end, neither Australia nor Antarctica matched European expectations about the 'Southern Land', though Australia, being the first that Europeans visited, acquired the name. New South Wales was invaded by the British in 1788. The term 'Australia' was substituted for 'Terra Australis' in 1813. The colonies of Australia federated into a single Commonwealth in 1901. The resulting Commonwealth of Australia only achieved full independence from Britain in 1988. Of course, human occupation predates the British invasion by tens of thousands of years. In the course of that human occupation, the very shape of the Australian landmass has varied. 10,000 years ago, the Australian mainland, Papua New Guinea and Tasmania formed a single contiguous landmass that geologers call [Sahul](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sahul). Are all the people who occupied Sahul at any point in time 'Australians'? Or can only residents or citizens of the country 'Australia' be so named? Like space, time wreaks havoc on the category 'Australian'.

Wikidata's contributors are aware of these difficulties. The simplest way to mark someone as 'Australian' in Wikidata is to give 'Australia' as the person's 'country of citizenship' ([P27](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Property:P27)). Our dataset contains `r wikidata_australians %>% filter(source == "aus_citizens_wd") %>% nrow() %>% prettyNum(',')` 'Australian citizens' according to P27. A glance at [the Talk page for P27](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Property_talk:P27) reveals that Wikimedians are keenly aware of the difficulties of space and time.

The user Ghouston clearly clearly articulated the problem of time in a post from 2018:

> It's not easy. Australian citizenship didn't exist before 1949, yet Australia as a federation has existed since 1901 and the term "Australian" was in use in the 19th century. To say that the United Kingdom was created in 1927 or the Netherlands perhaps in 1815 or 1945 or China in 1949 is to ignore much of the history of these countries as states.

Two years later, Ghouston provided additional sources and mentioned a possible solution:

> Separate items for citizenships and nationalities have been proposed previously. Perhaps it would help. The term "Australian" for people living in Australia was already used in the 19th century, before Australia had even been federated as a state, e.g., [[2](https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/197054485)]. According to [[3](https://www.passport-collector.com/evolution-australian-passport/)], Australia started issuing passports after federation, and didn't even restrict it to British subjects until 1938, but it seems that passports were not used much prior to WW1, and there was a more flexible attitude to nationality.

At the time of writing, there is [no Wikidata property for 'nationality'](https://www.wikidata.org/w/index.php?title=Wikidata:Property_proposal/Nationality&oldid=1232071609). Instead, the property of citizenship is limited according to the 'inception' ([P571](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Property:P571)) of the given country and the death date of the given person. The start date of Australia is given as [1 January 1901 in Wikidata](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q408#P571). If a person is assigned Australian citizenship in Wikidata, and their death date occurs before 1 January 1901, then a warning appears in their Wikidata page. At the time of writing, [the Wikidata item for colonial poet Charles Harpur](https://www.wikidata.org/w/index.php?title=Q1064745&oldid=1933534532) contains such a warning (@fig-citizenship-warning). Harpur, who proudly described himself as as 'An Australian' [in newspaper publications from the 1830s](http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article32148201), died in 1868.

![Citzenship warning banner for Charles Harpur](assets/citizenship-warning.png){#fig-citizenship-warning}

This solution combines flexibility with clarity.

- Flexibility: It is possible to mark the 'Australianness' of Charles Harpur and others who have been identified as Australian throughout history.
- Clarity: Wikidata provides clear guidance to its contributors through the warning banner. As far as Wikidata is concerned, Australian citizenship was available to people from 1901.

The price of this clarity and flexibility is inconsistency and quixotism. 

- Inconsistency: Wikidata flatly contradicts itself as far as historical figures like Charles Harpur are concerned. Was Harpur a citizen of Australia or not? Wikidata also contradicts, or at least brings into question, its own definition of 'citizenship'. Wikidata defines citizenship (P27) thus: '[the object is a country that recognizes the subject as its citizen](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Property:P27)' This definition is not reflected in P27's rules: all that is required is that the country exists prior to the supposed citizen's birth date. If Harpur were posthumously recognised as a citizen by the Commonwealth of Australia, this could not currently be reflected in the database. The warning banner would remain.
- Quixotism: As Ghouston himself observes, Australia did not have an official system for conferring citizenship until 1949. By seeming to choose 1 January 1901 as earliest permitted date, Wikidata has invented its own concept of Australian citizenship. Is this quixotism consistent with Wikidata's self-description as a '[secondary database, collecting structured data](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:Introduction)'? Does Wikidata collect structured data, or does it structure collected data?

Wikimedians are aware of the difficulty of time. The state of P27 suggests that they are content for the minute to leave the difficulty unresolved.

The difficulty of space is less clearly articulated on the talk page for P27 ('country of citizenship'). Perhaps this is because the concept 'citizenship' presupposes a deep and publicly sanctioned connection between the person and the country. In a sense, Wikidata delegates the question of a person's spatial connection to Australia, by recording when a person appears in a known database of Australians. These databases make their own decisions about the 'Australianness' of their subjects. The Dictionary of Australian Biography, for example, does not required its subjects to be Australian at all, as explained [in their FAQs](https://adb.anu.edu.au/faqs/#aussie):

> **Do you have to be an Australian to be in the ADB?**  
The ADB includes anyone who has made a significant contribution to the Australian nation.

The AusStage database, meanwhile, [records any person who 'contributed' in some way to a theatrical performance in Australia, or to an overseas performance of an Australian theatrical work](https://www.ausstage.edu.au/pages/learn/data-scope). AusStage and the Australian Dictionary of Biography provide very broad markers of Australianness. By contrast, the [Re-Member database of the Parliament of Victoria](https://www.parliament.vic.gov.au/about/people-in-parliament/re-member/form/27) provides a stricter marker of a person's Australianness. To appear in Re-Member, a person must be a former member of the Parliament of Victoria. We identified dozens of other databases that indicated 'Australianess' in Wikidata. When a Wikimedian links a person to the Australian Dictionary of Biography ([P1907](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Property:P1907)), AusStage ([P8292](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Property:P8292)), Re-Member ([P8633](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Property:P8633)), or some other database of Australians, the linked database will encode a different answer to the question 'Who Counts as Australian?'

This raises the question: how do these different properties overlap in Wikidata? Are there some markers of Australianness that tend to go together? Are there others that exclude each other? For example, we might assume that if a person is linked to the  Convict Records of Australia database ([P9919](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Property:P9919)), they should not usually have Australia as their place of birth, since the great majority of convicts were transported from Britain and Ireland, rather than between the colonies.

To explore the connection between different markers of Australianness, we generated a correlation plot between the `r (num_properties_for_cor <- 20)` most common Wikidata properties of the `r unique(wikidata_australians$source) %>% length()` that we queried (@fig-wikidata-property-matrix). A red square indicates a positive correlation between two Wikidata properties: for example, a person with an [Australian Dictionary of Biography ID](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Property:P1907) (`aus_dictionary_bio`) is highly likely also to have a [People Australia ID](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Property:P9159) (`people_of_aus`). A blue square indicates a negative correlation between two properties: for example, a person marked as a citizen of Australia is highly unlikely to have been assigned an [AustralianFootball.com ID](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Property:P3546) (`aus_football`).

```{r}
#| label: fig-wikidata-property-matrix
#| fig-cap: Few of the properties are strongly correlated
source_matrix <- wikidata_australians %>% 
  select(person, source) %>% 
  distinct(person, source) %>% 
  nest(data = person) %>% 
  mutate(group_total = map_int(data, nrow)) %>% 
  arrange(desc(group_total)) %>% 
  head(num_properties_for_cor) %>% 
  select(-group_total) %>% 
  unnest(cols = c(data)) %>% 
  mutate(n = 1) %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from = source, values_from = n, values_fill = 0) %>% 
  select(-person) %>% 
  cor()

ggcorrplot::ggcorrplot(
  source_matrix,
  hc.order = TRUE,
  insig = "blank"
  )
```

Only a few of the properties are correlated, and there are only a couple of strong correlations in the matrix.

Many of the strong correlations reflect relationships between the databases on which Wikidata relies for information. For example, it is not surprising to see a strong correlation between Australian Dictionary of Biography ID (`aus_dictionary_bio`), Labour Australia ID (`labour_of_aus`), People Australia ID (`people_of_aus`) and Obituaries of Australia ID (`obit_of_aus`). These four databases are all run by the National Centre for Biography at the Australian National University, and are tightly interconnected. Every person in Obituaries Australia, Labour Australia or the ADB automatically receives a People Australia ID.

Other strong correlations represent a similarity of subject-matter. For instance, three Wikidata properties link to databases of Australian artists (`nat_gallery_vic_artist`, `aus_printmakers`, `design_and_art_aus` [bug - wrongly appears here as `Vic_parliament_aus`]). A person who has an ID in one of these external databases is likely to have an ID available in the others. Similar explanations apply to sporting databases (`atheltics_aus` and `aus_olympics`) and newspaper databases (`trove_aus`, `obit_of_aus`).

Some of the negative correlations also reflect the subject-matter of the different properites. For example, the negative correlation between the Australian citizenship property and IDs in the ADB and People Australia reflects the fact that the ADB and People Australia mostly record historical people, many of whose 'citizenship' would be questionable, as explained above.

In other cases, however, the correlation is harder to explain. Why is an AustralianFootball.com ID negatively correlated with most of the other top 20 properties?
