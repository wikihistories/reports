# wikihistories reports

Annual reports to the Wikipedia community and Wikimedia Foundation of the [wikihistories](https://wikihistories.net) project.

This is a quarto website containing all the reports of the wikihistories project. We aim for fully reproducible research. All the code used to fetch, analyse and visualise the data is in this repository; all the text explaining our reasoning is in the relevant `.qmd` documents.

The `main` branch contains our polished work for publication. Drafts and scratch-work for each Annual Report are contained in branches labelled by year.
