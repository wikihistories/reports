    "text": "Who counts as Australian in Wikipedia and its sister-projects? How does Wikipedia portray Australia’s population? These questions are easy to ask but hard to answer, because of Wikipedia’s representational multiplicity. Wikipedia represents Australia in many ways. Its sister projects—Wikidata and Wikimedia Commons preminent among them—represent Australia in myriad other ways.\nIn this report, we consider several ways that Australians are represented in Wikipedia and Wikidata. We focus on four main modes of representation:\nIn Conclusion: beyond bias, we make some suggestions about how Wikipedians might like to improve the representation of Australians in the encyclopaedia. As well as addressing the traditional problem of ‘systemic bias’, we suggest that Wikipedians draw attention to the representational multiplicity of Wikipedia, so that visitors to the site can become more aware of the multiple definitions of ‘Australianness’ across the Wikiverse."
