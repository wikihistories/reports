    "text": "Executive Summary\nThis year, the wikihistories team set out to understand how well Wikipedia represents Australian places and what kinds of editing practices drive those representations.\nExamining 35,000 articles about Australian places and interviewing volunteer editors, we found that English Wikipedia reflects an anthropocentric and neo-colonial image of Australia as a place.\nEnglish Wikipedia’s representation of Australian places is anthropocentric. The further you move from the cities, the fewer articles there are. Across Australia’s arid centre, there are very few articles indeed. Not only are there more articles about Australia’s large cities on English Wikipedia, but editors devote considerably more attention to them.\nEnglish Wikipedia’s representation of Australian places is neocolonial rather than conservative. The cities, towns, and administrative divisions founded by European settlers guide the creation, editing and reading of Wikipedia articles. First Nations, ecological, or cosmopolitan senses of place need to fight or negotiate to find room within this nationalist European structure. In contrast, there are articles about fictional Australian places on English Wikipedia including “Erinsborough” from Neighbours.\nInterviewing editors and examining editing practice we found that editors have differing motivations for editing, beliefs about Wikipedia, reflexivities about their own position, commitments to diverse perspectives, and relationships to the places they edited articles about. This heterogeneity exists within an editor cohort dominated by tech-savvy, white, educated men, echoing previous studies on Wikipedia editor demographics.\nAffective and interpersonal relations drive editing practice around place articles. Emotional drivers include: editors’ feeling pride in a place and wanting to write about it; the feeling of shame or defensiveness about settler-colonial history; and experiences of discomfort in what can and cannot be written about on Wikipedia. Wikipedia editors sometimes collaborate genially with one another, but many editors reported how conflict with other editors shapes how they write about place.\nControversy and conflict are the result of disagreements over the representations of places and are a common occurrence on Wikipedia. Among the most contentious issues on Australian place articles included republicanism, colonisation and the inclusion of First Nations place names. Many Wikipedia editors’ experiences of contentiousness include burning out, running out of energy, and being drained.\nSome editors avoid contentious articles entirely, reducing the numbers of those editors (especially those with experience) editing such articles. Editors often avoid including negative aspects of a place (e.g. discriminatory Australian government policy and violence against First Nations peoples) in articles when it is uncomfortable. Others see it as their responsibility to include First Nations’ perspectives, even though they report being met with heavy resistance. The result is that although there is enthusiasm about including marginalised voices and filling in gaps on Wikipedia, this is being met by a spectrum of reluctance, hesitation, discomfort, sanitisation and also active resistance and racism.\nUnderstanding what Wikipedia’s strengths and weaknesses are, and how knowledge is produced on the platform is vital to evaluating the information it produces. The site and its associated platforms are core components of the knowledge ecosystem, used to train large language models like ChatGPT and as a data source for Google infoboxes and voice assistants like Siri and Alexa. As a result, Wikipedia’s representations can have significant effects on what is known and understood about Australian places.\nFor Australian readers the research provides insight into the contention around the history and understandings of Australian places and the markers of “Australianness”. For government policymakers there are implications for education curricula, especially in incorporating critical digital literacy skills in using Wikipedia and understanding its role in the wider digital and knowledge ecosystems. And, for Wikimedia Foundation and Wikipedia editors there are significant implications for policy and practice in relation to engagement with First Nations content and experience."

    "text": "Introduction\n\nThe land and sea not empty shed that man has built. There’s something in it.\n—Matthew Dhulumburrk with Mark Dreyfus (Northern Land Council), quoted in Rose (1996, 8)\n\nWe navigate to, from, around and inside places using our digital devices today. Places are increasingly datafied. They are “made of bits as well as atoms” (Graham and Zook 2013). These digital representations of place sit alongside the knowledges that enliven place. Whereas knowledge exists in the body and in the flow of everyday practice, information is an abstraction. Information about places are selective representations of knowledge that can never fully embody what we know. Despite this, information - increasingly digitised - is powerful in driving what places become. Place information can influence property prices, tourism, quality of life and our sense of belonging.\nIn our digitally mediated experience of the everyday, a single platform provides much of the data used to explain and augment place: Wikipedia. Wikipedia is consistently in the top ten most popular websites in the world. With almost 7 million pages, 1.5 billion unique device visits and 13 million edits per month, English Wikipedia is the largest and most-read reference work in history. It is built and maintained by the contributions of its volunteer editors and funded through readers and other donors.\nWikipedia is the encyclopedia that “anyone can edit” at any time. These affordances lead many to believe that Wikipedia covers everything. But Wikipedia hasn’t covered everything yet. What’s more: we can see trends in what Wikipedia doesn’t cover (or covers weakly). These trends indicate Wikipedia’s biases… its “known unknowns”.\nPrevious studies of Wikipedia articles about places have demonstrated that Wikipedia tends to cover fictional places from popular culture more extensively than large parts of the Majority World. Professor Mark Graham from the Oxford Internet Institute found in 2009 that “there [were] more Wikipedia articles written about the fictional places of Middle Earth and Discworld than about many countries in Africa, Asia, and the Americas” (Graham, 2009). Subsequent studies found that Wikipedia was reinforcing global inequalities as the platform was far more likely to represent places, people and topics from the Global North than the Global South (Majority World) (Graham et. al. 2014).\nBut what of a single country like Australia? How well does Wikipedia cover Australian places? Are there any trends in what are covered well, less well or not at all? What explains these differences if “anyone can edit” Wikipedia?\nGeographical scope is rarely studied at the national level, but this is exactly the focus of the wikihistories project, an Australian Research Council-funded Discovery Project investigating how Wikipedia represents Australian people, places and events. Last year we examined how Wikipedia represents Australian people (Falk, Ford, Tall and Pietsch 2023). This year we examine how Wikipedia represents Australian places in a large-scale mixed methods analysis. This included an analysis of over 35,000 articles about Australian places on English Wikipedia and over half a million edits to those articles. It also included in-depth interviews with a number of editors of Australian place articles and the analysis of selected articles’ content.\nThe objectives of the wikihistories project are to analyse the scope of entries relating to Australia on Wikipedia in order to understand who and what is systematically omitted. We do this because representations of people, places and events on Wikipedia are important. Wikipedia contributes to the nation’s story. How Wikipedia represents places influences our relationships to place. Wikipedia is the world’s premier source of facts and has a significant impact on how people view the world.\nWe also do this because, although Wikipedia is generally a high-quality source on people, places, events and things, it is not perfect. Like all sources, it represents a partial or biased view. Understanding this partiality is crucial to being able to evaluate what Wikipedia tells us about the world and bring a critical lens to the information that is based or trained on Wikipedia, such as generative AI tools like ChatGPT, Google search and infoboxes, and voice assistants like Alexa.\nWhen searching for information on Wikipedia, it is helpful to understand why places are represented in the way that they are. It’s helpful because Wikipedia articles about places don’t necessarily represent all views connected to a place. Instead, Wikipedia’s information is the (current) result of negotiation among editors and their affective responses to the subjects they are writing about. In addition to care, deliberation, responsibility and passion for place, Wikipedia itself is a place rife with conflict and derision. Learning that Wikipedia articles about places are shaped as much by technical affordances as social and personal relations is key to understanding what Wikipedia produces."

    "text": "What Australian Places are Included on Wikipedia?\n35,077 Australian places have an article on English Wikipedia. We calculate this figure using Wikidata’s query engine. Using Wikidata, we find every physical location or geographic feature that has the property country:Australia. Using Wikidata, we retrieve coordinates for each place. Using English Wikipedia, we retrieve the text of each article and the number of edits.\nIt is important to note that together, Wikipedia and Wikidata construct space in a particular way. According to this perspective, space is made up of physical locations and geographical features. Each feature or location is assigned a Wikidata ID, a Wikipedia article, and a set of coordinates. In this familiar model of space, the earth is a continuous surface, upon which individual places can be precisely located.\nWikipedia’s spatial system is typical, and interoperates with other digital systems. For example, a visitor to the Wikipedia page for Townsville can view data derived directly from the Australian Bureau of Statistics, such as the population or area of the city. If the visitor clicks on Townsville’s co-ordinates, they will be taken to the city’s geohack page, which connects the Wikipedia article to dozens of other compatible systems, such as Google Maps and NASA Worldwind. If the user clicks Tools → Wikidata Item, they will arrive at Townsville’s Wikidata page, which links them to other-language Wikipedia articles about Townsville, and also links to Townsville’s record in other databases, such as VIAF, GeoNames and the National Library of Latvia. Wikipedia is part of a vast network of systems that all cooperate to construct the space of the Earth in a certain way.\nThis way of constructing space is not the only way. In particular, it is inconsistent with many of the ways that First Nations people construct space. We will return to these differences later in the report."

    "section": "1. How does Wikipedia represent Australia as a place?",
    "text": "1. How does Wikipedia represent Australia as a place?\nEnglish Wikipedia constructs Australia from a human, and more specifically and white-settler perspective. Figure 1 show the distribution of place articles across the continent of Australia. There are many articles about the large capital cities of Perth, Adelaide, Melbourne, Sydney and Brisbane, whose central areas appear as bright yellow hexagons on the map. There may be more than 1000 articles describing places in each of these cities. The further you move from the cities, the fewer articles there are. Across Australia’s arid centre, there are very few articles indeed.\nIt may seem obvious that Wikipedians should focus their attention on cities and other places of human habitation. But this is not the only way. Figure 2 shows the distribution of Australian places in Cebuano Wikipedia. As shown in Figure 5, Cebuano has a much stronger focus on natural features than English Wikipedia does. Since natural features such as rivers, knolls and valleys are distributed evenly across the landscape, Australian places in Cebuano Wikipedia are distributed more evenly across the continent.\nThe human focus of English Wikipedia is accentuated in Figure 3, which visualises edit activity. Not only are there more articles about the Australia’s large cities on English Wikipedia, but editors devote considerably more attention to them. There are numerous small regions near the big cities where human editors have made more than 100,000 edits. To put this in perspective, the total number of human edits in the dataset is 1,499,782. A few regions with more than 100,000 edits each form a significant part of this total.\nIn sum, English Wikipedia is strongly anthropocentric. The places that matter are human places. More than this, they are white-settler places. English Wikipedia’s focus is on the cities, states and country of Australia, as established by predominately British settlers in the Eighteenth and Nineteenth Centuries.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: All Australian places in English Wikipedia that lie on or near the Australian mainland. Each hexagon represents an equally-sized zone of the earth’s surface, and is coloured to represent how many articles are written about places in that zone.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Like Figure 1, but for Cebuano Wikipedia. Since Cebuano Wikipedia focuses on geographic features rather than human habitation, its place articles are more evenly distributed across the continent.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: This map counts the number of edits rather than the number of places in each hexagon. English Wikipedia’s editors focus their attention overwhelmingly on metropolitan centres and surrounding regions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhich language edition has the most Australian places?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: The Cebuano and Swedish Wikipedias have many articles written by a software program, lsjbot. Swedish Wikipedians have in recent years deleted most of lsjbot’s articles, but the small community of Cebuano editors in the Philippines have not done so in their encyclopaedia.\n\n\n\n\n\nWikipedia is available in more than 300 languages. You might expect that English Wikipedia would have the most articles about Australian places—but you’d be wrong. Figure 4 shows that Cebuano Wikipedia has by far the largest number of articles about Australian places. Tens of thousands of Australian places, such as Molecap Hill, Dindum Island and Mount Finlayson Range, have articles only in Cebuano Wikipedia. Why is this?\nIt is not because the speakers of the Cebuano language in Philippines are obsessed with Australian geography. It is because virtually the whole Cebuano Wikipedia has been written by a bot, lsjbot, programmed by Sverker Johansson, a Swedish computational linguist. lsjbot was historically responsible for a large portion of Swedish Wikipedia too, and despite efforts by Swedish Wikipedians to delete its formulaic articles, lsjbot is still responsible for many Swedish articles about obscure Australian places, including Dawes National Park and Lake Baker. The story is similar on Egyptian Arabic Wikipedia. Egyptian Arabic Wikipedia contains thousands of articles about Australian places because of one editor, Mahar Asaad Baker, who describes in a published booklet how they wrote 1.6 million articles by downloading data from Wikidata and converting it into Masri text for the site.\nHow is it possible for simple software to generate so many factually accurate articles about Australian places? Read any article by lsjbot, and you will see how thoroughly geography has been ‘datified’ in the 21st century. A global database, geonames.org records basic data about millions of place names. lsjbot browses geonames.org to find places without Wikipedia articles. When it finds a missing article, lsjbot extracts basic information from geonames.org, such as the type, name, and co-ordinates of the place. The bot then combines the basic information with publicly-available climate data from NASA Earth Observations datasets, and uses this climatic map to determine the place’s Köppen climate classification.1 lsjbot takes advantage of geospatial data to create articles about the earth’s physical geography. We will see that the human editors of English Wikipedia describe places more humanistically.\n\n\nWhat is included in articles about Australian places?\nTo see how Wikipedians describe individual places, we closely analysed three articles at three geographical scales: the national (Australia), state (Tasmania) and local (Katoomba).\nAll three follow a similar structure, foregrounding economics, politics and geography. A key function of each article is to locate each place in relation to other political and economic entities on the surface of the earth. The Infobox locates each place politically and physically: a map; locating coordinates, some information about the relevant government for the area. The first few paragraphs–the ‘lead section’–is crucial: several editors we spoke with suggested that most people only read the lead section so it is the section that must do the heavy lifting. For these three articles, the lead section mentions the place’s geographical location, history, and notable characteristics. Notable characteristics are typically economic or political. For instance, Katoomba “is a base for bush and nature walks,” while Australia is “a major non-NATO ally of the United States” To prove the notability of these facts, Wikipedians often rank them. For instance, Tasmania is the “most decentralised state in Australia” with 42% of its land earmarked as “protected”, while Australia has“one of the highest per capita incomes globally” and ranks “highly” for quality of life, health and education, and civil liberties.\nThe article headings also contribute to locate each place in space and time: history, geography, demography, culture. The Australia and Tasmania pages have sections on government and economy, the Katoomba page includes sections on tourism–a major industry in Katoomba–and heritage listings. This small sample suggests that Wikipedia’s editors are primarily focussed on locating and ranking places on the surface of the globe. What matters most is how a place fits into the geographical and political divisions of the human world. On the one hand, this is an objective focus—the meaning of a place to its inhabitants is relatively unimportant. On the other hand, this is an anthropocentric focus—the meaning of a place to non-human entities is at best only secondary.\nWe also looked at another kind of Australian place representation: that of fictional Australian places. The category for ‘Fictional populated places in Australia’ contains 19 places. Three have their own article: Erinsborough, the suburb of Melbourne where TV soap ‘Neighbours’ is set; Mount Thomas, the rural setting of TV show ‘Blue Heelers’, and Summer Bay, the coastal town where TV soap ‘Home and Away’ takes place. There is also the category ‘fictional locations in Australia’ of which there is only one: The Speewah. While there is a Speewah property in the Northern Territory, “the Speewah” refers to an ‘an imaginary Australian cattle station or place used as a setting for tall stories of the outback’ (Knowles 2006). The Speewah “moves”, according to the needs and contexts of the storyteller. It is an idea that has some resonances with how Australian place articles themselves function on English Wikipedia."

    "text": "2. What editing practices drive this shaping?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5: This shows all the types of places that have at least 50 articles about them in English and Cebuano Wikipedia. The types are positioned on the graph according to the percentage of articles of that type in the dataset. Types below the line have a higher proportion in English Wikipedia than in Cebuano Wikipedia, and vice-versa. The brighter blue the label, the more often places of that type have been edited in English Wikipedia.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf we compare Cebuano and English Wikipedias, we see that human and bot editors have different priorities. Broadly speaking, Cebuano Wikipedia is bot-authored, while English Wikipedia is human-authored.2 In English Wikipedia, places of human occupation make up a bigger proportion of the total. Towns, localities, cities, urban parks and villages all make up a larger proportion of the place articles in English Wikipedia than in Cebuano Wikipedia. By contrast, in bot-authored Cebuano Wikipedia, geographical features such as mountains, lakes, bights and hills make up a much larger share of the Australian place articles. This difference is even more pronounced when we consider edit statistics on English Wikipedia. Consider articles about cities. Cities account for only 0.24% of the Australian places on English Wikipedia (0.10% in Cebuano), but they have received 5% of the human edits.3 Not only are human editors more likely to create articles about places with a strong human connection. They are also more likely to spend their time editing them.\nEnglish Wikipedia is strongly anthropocentric, at least compared to the geographical databases that form the basis of bot-authored Cebuano Wikipedia. English Wikipedia prioritises human over physical geography.\n\nWho edits Wikipedia articles about Australian places?\nThis research is the first to engage with who edits articles about Australia on English Wikipedia. To do so is inevitably challenging. Wikipedia editors contribute under pseudonyms (called usernames) and, in some instances, “anonymously” (where edits are represented using their IP addresses). Participants described experiences where they were unsure whether, in contentious debates, they were arguing with a group of people or one person using a variety of usernames. The latter is called sockpuppetry and, even though it is forbidden on Wikipedia, it is difficult to control. At least one editor involved in this project has two usernames. Anonymity is taken seriously. Charlie4 suggested that other Wikipedians may not want to participate in the research as it would reveal their identity to the research team. Some other participants were careful about mentioning other people’s usernames and asked us not to mention that they had to the editor in question.\nThe Wikipedians we spoke with had some assumptions about who edited Australian place articles on Wikipedia: the dominant suggestions were that they were white men across a range of ages who were tech-savvy, had access to a computer and were well-educated. “Wikipedia is overwhelmingly white, and then, within that, it’s overwhelmingly white male,” Ellis said. Gabriel and Lucas said the same thing, both adding they felt Wikipedia editors were generally “conservative-leaning.” In terms of ages, both David and James “assum[ed]” Wikipedia editors were men in their 30s and 40s, with David adding that Wikipedia had “always been attractive to university students.” Conversely, Blake–who is one of the few editors interviewed for this research that attends offline Wikipedian gatherings–and Lucas felt a significant proportion of editors contributing to Australian place articles were retirees.\nAvailable time and tech savviness were common suggestions. James argued that Wikipedia “favoured people that either had a lot of time on their hands or [are] tech savvy.” To participate in Wikipedia, Ellis said, you need a computer, “some level of education” and regular access to the Internet. With that said, even Wikipedians can’t be positive as to who is contributing. After Jack had described who he thought edited Australia place articles, he concluded “but maybe that’s not true”. Nate was equally unsure. “Sometimes I don’t know how old they are. I don’t know whether they’re male or female. I don’t know what they do when they’re not editing Wikipedia,” he said.\nThe tech-savvy, white, educated and men-dominated demographic suggested above was reflected in our interview cohort. One participant identified as a woman and one participant identified as non-binary. As Ellis and James suggested, the people we spoke with were technologically adept: most interviews were conducted over Zoom and, as the interview progressed, the participant would often simultaneously check Wikipedia revision histories, their edits, or a relevant Wikiproject throughout to assist in answering questions. David made an edit to Wikipedia as we were speaking. Interview participants were academics, librarians, postgraduate students, lawyers, high school teachers, bloggers, community workers, and store managers, although several are retired now. Two had PhDs and a majority had a university education.\nThe people we spoke with are not homogenous. There is a picture of Wikipedia editors that has emerged in recent years. In this picture, Wikipedians are rigid, inflexible about enforcing Wikipedian policy, and resistant to other ways of producing knowledge outside of a rationalist, Eurocentric, written source-based approach. What emerged in the research is more complex. The editors we spoke with encompassed a wide range of positions on how and what Wikipedia should be. Certainly, a few were very committed to rules and Wikipedia policy. Conversely, several were aware of common perceptions about Wikipedians and were reflexive about their position and practice. As Ellis described,\n\nI’m bringing my own unconscious biases to everything I do. I can’t change the fact I’m a white, middle-aged, middle-class male. Okay, no matter what I try to do, that’s always going to follow my thinking. So yeah. But, you know, you do the best you can.\n\nJack was similarly aware of how his experience as a white man may influence his editing practice. Finally, Gabriel and Lucas were openly interested in broadening Wikipedia through their editing practice and representing marginalised aspects of place, such as queer, disabled and First Nations histories and experiences of a place. To make things even more complex, some people we spoke with demonstrated a mix of the above attitudes: concerned to support diverse perspectives on one hand, while simultaneously acting to resist the incorporation of First Nations placenames on the other, as described later in the report.\n\n\nWhy do Wikipedia editors edit Australian place articles?\nFor some people, editing a Wikipedia page about an Australian place is personal: they are writing about a place in which they live now and/or grew up. James has been editing Wikipedia for 20 years and started editing through a mixture of curiosity and interest in Wikipedia’s new technology. An equal motivation, however, was “a sense of pride. Sort of liking Tasmania, liking living there, wanting Tasmania to be presented well”. Gabriel described editing the Tasmania page as editing about something “close to my own heart”. For Jack, editing Wikipedia is, in some ways, a conversation he is having with his younger self: “I add stuff to Wikipedia that I think I wish I knew about,” he said.\nFor others, editing an Australian place article is the result of their usual Wikipedia practice and not about an interest in a specific place. Charlie is interested in demographic data and so will update multiple place articles when new Census data is released. Likewise, Nate focuses on copyediting across a number of articles, fixing errors in spelling, punctuation or appearance.\nFor others, there is a sense of Wikipedia’s role in the wider knowledge ecosystem and the “big responsibility of Wikipedia,” as Blake described it. Blake recounted once hearing Siri, a voice assistant, tell “something really awful like, you know, it’ll say ‘Oh the demonym of Tasmanians is, you know, two heads’.” His response was inflected with personal responsibility: “I panic and go ‘Oh is that on Wikipedia?!’.” It’s one of the reasons Blake keeps an eye on all the “state” pages, including Tasmania. Judy has a longer-term view and describes her commitment to ensuring Australian places, particularly smaller places, are represented on the Internet and for posterity. Judy treasures almanacs and “old gazetteers” and feels that Wikipedia has similarities: “I’m leaving the equivalent thing behind, that this stuff will survive me.”\nThe motivations, practices, and experiences of editing Australian place articles vary according to the place and whether or not the article is a “main page”. Bill and David both pointed out that editing practices for main pages–such as Australia or Tasmania–are different to working on smaller pages. Not only are main pages more contentious, they also “attract a certain sort of edit and edit style” such as small alterations to expression or punctuation, rather than significant new contributions, mostly as a result of how long the article has existed in its current form and its size.\nThe variety in editing practice is evident when examining the analysed pages. Of all the Katoomba article editors interviewed, only one had a personal connection to Katoomba. All other editors were “practice-focused” editors: they update demographic data across many articles; they focus on copyediting rather than content; or they tend to pop a fact into any Wikipedia page if they come across something interesting in their everyday reading. In these instances, their Wikipedia foci and practices led them to edit to the Katoomba page. The Australia article editors interviewed for this research were usually high-edit Wikipedians with extensive experience and have contributed to the page–among many others–at some point.\nThe editors of the Tasmania page who participated had more placially-specific motivations for contributing to the page. All were Tasmanian. As discussed above, David, Gabriel and James mentioned pride in and love for Tasmania as motivations for contributing to the article. Gabriel and James also pointed towards a perception of Tasmania as underrepresented on Wikipedia and in Australia generally. Tasmania, Gabriel said, is an “under-served topic” and can “often be completely forgotten about by the rest of this country.”\nOnly one of the Tasmania page editors still lives in Tasmania, a fact that did not surprise any Tasmanian interviewed for this research. “All of my friends left,” said Ellis. David, James and Blake suggested a similar experience. When asked whether contributing to the Tasmania Wikipedia page was a dimension of his experience of having migrated away from Tasmania, Ellis said it was one of his initial motivations to become involved. David didn’t say that, exactly, but pointed out “as often happens in a diaspora situation, in some ways it becomes more important after you leave.” Unlike the contributors to the Australia and Katoomba page, Tasmania page editors interviewed for this research were more personally connected to the topic, were more interested in Wikipedia as a medium of asserting what they saw as under-recognised aspects of a place, and–in some instances–used their work on Wikipedia as a tangential but real ongoing connection to place.\n\n\nWhat drives conflict around Australian places?\nSome Wikipedia pages are more controversial than others. Wikipedia contributors have argued for years over whether Pavolva was invented in Australia or New Zealand. Other pages inspire little debate. It is not easy to locate or rank contentious articles using computerised methods. Contention can take many forms: editors might ‘revert’ (i.e. undo) one another’s edits; they might debate topics in-depth on Wikipedia Talk pages; they might abuse one another ‘off-wiki’; they might accuse one another of misconduct, and be subject to administrative redress. For simplicity’s sake, we focus just on the first manifestation of contention, when Wikipedians ‘revert’ or undo each others’ edits.\n\n\n\n\n\n10 articles (&gt; 50 edits) with most reverts per edit. Data collected 21 October 2024.\n\n\nArticle\nEdits\nReverts\nReverts per Edit\n\n\n\n\nGiru, Queensland\n87\n97\n1.11\n\n\nEungai railway station\n53\n47\n0.89\n\n\nEastgardens, New South Wales\n62\n49\n0.79\n\n\nNambucca Heads railway station\n37\n23\n0.62\n\n\nBarmah National Park\n70\n39\n0.56\n\n\nCastle Cove, New South Wales\n120\n65\n0.54\n\n\nHome Hill, Queensland\n161\n81\n0.50\n\n\nShalom House\n67\n33\n0.49\n\n\nRepatriation General Hospital, Daw Park\n37\n18\n0.49\n\n\nHoward Springs, Northern Territory\n76\n36\n0.47\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6: These 10 articles have the highest ratio of ‘reverts’ to ‘human edits’ in the dataset, of all articles with more than 50 edits. Are they the most contentious articles in the dataset? That question is impossible to answer by such a simple measure.\n\n\n\n\nIn Figure 6, we have attempted to find 10 highly contentious Places using a simple metric. The figure shows the 10 Australian places that have been edited at least 50 times, with the highest ratio of ‘reverted’ edits to human edits. For example, the little article on Barmah National Park has only had text added to it 70 times, but more than half (39) of those edits have been reverted! The reason is a long-running dispute over whether horses in the national park should be considered as ‘wild’ or ‘feral’. This debate reflects a deep anxiety in Australia about the moral value of European settlement. Some White Australians see the horses (or ‘brumbies’) as part of Australia’s European heritage. Others view them as an invasive species that represent the destructive history of European colonisation. Other examples in Figure 6 reflect similarly emotional conflicts in Australian society. The page for Howard Springs was subject to an ‘edit war’ during the pandemic, when one editor wished to redefine the local COVID-19 Quarantine Facility as a “Concentration Camp.” The page for Airport Drive, meanwhile, was subject to an altogether less emotional dispute: the editors could not agree which other roads intersect with this Melbourne motorway.\nAs these few examples demonstrate, Australian places can inspire many kinds of dispute: disputes about Australia’s colonisation, disputes about civil liberties, disputes about arid matters of geographical fact. Sometimes apparent disputes are actually simple vandalism, as in the page for Giru, Queensland whose Infobox has been vandalised numerous times to place the city “1,283 km (797 mi) NNW of Miley Cyrus.”\n\nEditors’ experiences of contentiousness\nLucas stopped editing Wikipedia in the end. “To still have to be making these arguments,” he said, “it’s just really, really frustrating. And yeah, I just ran out of energy for it.” Other editors have increasingly avoided topics that are likely to attract contentiousness. Bill no longer edits main pages, what he calls “overview pages,” such as the Australia page: “I haven’t got anywhere near them for over 10 years. It’s usually a minefield.” David agreed that pages like Australia and Tasmania were often more contentious. In his experience, “the bigger the article, the more traffic, the more edit wars.” He also stays away from those pages now: “being on bigger pages with battles. I guess I’ve been, if not burnt…. at least sort of, I’ve got tired of that.” James said the same thing. “You just you end up you keep going to less and less controversial topics to avoid edit wars,” he said. Nate was an exception: he continued to participate in contentious discussions, including utilising formal review structures when he felt it was necessary.\nInterviewees had and continue to have a range of responses to these experiences of contentiousness. Burning out, running out of energy, or being drained was one response. “The contentious stuff,” Ellis said, “is emotionally draining.” Judy and Lucas both spoke of the fatigue of working on a contribution, only for it to be immediately changed. “I’m not going to write it,” Judy said, “because, you know, even though I’ve got what appears to me to be a reliable source, someone will come along and just change it.” Lucas described some edit wars as “satisfying” but ultimately it became “more frustrating than anything else.” “They’re not fun,” James said. Gabriel said that most of their discussions with other editors have been “very antagonistic and not particularly pleasant, to be frankly honest.”\nConsidering how many of the editors involved in this research had actively and increasingly avoided contestation over their careers, the obvious question becomes: if not them, who? Participants didn’t agree on who was “edit-warring” on Wikipedia. “Most edit wars are with a well-meaning but misguided, usually new editor,” David said. Lucas, on the other hand, felt the ongoing contestations came from experienced editors: “they would be users with a name who have been established for quite a while. And those would be the people who would be a problem.” David suggested a lot of the contestation resulted from a friction around what Wikipedia is for: “officially, Wikipedia is meant to lag everything else. It’s meant to lag the news and the books. There’s a fair percentage of people who want Wikipedia to lead the way.”\nBill felt place articles “were one of the least problematic areas of the whole Australian project.” His view was the exception. Of the other editors interviewed, there was very little disagreement about what the hot button topics were. As with the contentiousness of the Barmah National Park article, the contentious topics that editors identified reflect a deep anxiety about the ongoing understandings of European colonisation. “Some of the things that always tend to get disputed is stuff about Indigenous people, stuff about Mabo and stuff about the Republic,” Jack said. “The frontier conflict is obviously one of the big ones,” Judy noted. Editors occasionally used the word “culture” to describe what they tried to avoid. James said he stayed away from politics and “culture war stuff” and David didn’t engage with “culture” on Wikipedia as it “is probably too difficult.” In both instances, the editors were talking about First Nations and settler-colonial histories and aspects of place.\n\n\nCase study: First Nations place names\nNearly every editor we spoke with mentioned the inclusion of First Nations place names on Wikipedia as contentious. Editors involved in interviews came from various positions. Lucas, Blake and Gabriel actively worked to incorporate and maintain First Nations place names on Wikipedia. Indeed, it was Lucas’ main focus for his editing practice. Then there are people who try and stay out of it. James said, “one part of me wants to kind of go! Let’s get the Aboriginal names correct. But I can also imagine that that would be quite heated.” As mentioned above, Judy also avoids work on First Nations place names as she feels contributions in that area usually are changed very quickly. Nate and David have both contested the inclusion of a First Nations place name in a Wikipedia article on more than one occasion.\nFirst Nations place names generate so much interest for several reasons. James feels it is, in part, because “the names for things is such a Wikipedia-type territory, like it’s just naturally Wikipedia.” Finding the source, chasing down the most accurate name, and categorisation all accord with central aspects of the Wikipedia platform and the inclinations of many of those who edit the articles. Blake and Lucas both felt that racism is a factor for some editors who resist the incorporation of First Nations place names. There is, Blake stated, “some really awful, toxic sort of pushback on those things. Just for, you know, I guess what is almost really racist reasons.”\nThe principal way that editors can attach a First Nations name to a place is the “native name” system. There are two ways a Wikipedian can assign a “native name” to a Wikipedia article. They can insert Template:Native_name into the text of the article; or they can fill in the “native_name” field in articles “Infobox.” These two approaches to dual-naming can be seen on the articles for Naarm, Boorloo and Deerubbin.\nFigure 7 shows all the places in the dataset that have been dual-named on Wikipedia. 2,261 places in the dataset have been dual-named, or about 6% of the total. This is of course a small quantity, given that the entire Australian landmass had been occupied and named by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people for tens of thousands of years prior to European settlement.\nThere are two obvious flaws to Wikipedia’s dual-naming system.\nOffensive terminology: The term “native” is offensive in Australia. Australian Wikipedians know this. The members of Wikiproject Australia have cautioned other editors not to use the term in the text of articles, although they have not attempted to remove the term from Wikipedia’s software. Of course, Template:Native_name is not only used in an Australian context. The article for the Italian city of Florence, for example, gives “Firenze” as the “native name.”\nEuropean priority: The dual-naming system prioritises the European construction of place. Invariably, the article on English Wikipedia gives the settler name as the primary name. Thus a visitor to Boorloo will be redirected to an article entitled “Perth.” More deeply, for a place to even exist in Wikipedia, it first needs to exist in the European system of spatial divisions. When Europeans occupied Australia, they divided the landmass up into colonies, parishes, cities and later into states and suburbs, largely ignoring the structures that already existed in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander societies. The best that dual-naming can do is to attach an Indigenous name to one of these places established by settlers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7: Like Figure 1, but showing only those places with a First Nations name. They form only a small portion of the total.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDo emotions drive Wikipedia editing?\nNot all editors felt that emotions influenced their Wikipedia edits. The Wikipedians who mostly undertook routine edits–updating Census data, as Charlie does, or copy edits, as Nate does–mentioned less affectively charged experiences of editing Wikipedia pages. Others resisted the idea that their affective relations to a place had influenced their editing. When we asked Ellis whether he’d had any emotional reactions when writing about Tasmania, he was emphatic: “’no, no! None at all”.\nOther editors were more open to the role of affect and emotion in their editorial practice in writing about Australian places. “I think anything to do with the history”, Gabriel said, “can be quite fraught with emotions. Because, especially, when you’re dealing with really traumatic events that are still close in the memory of a lot of people.” For Gabriel, the collapse of the Tasman Bridge and the 1967 Tasmanian bushfires are “still very raw in the memories of people that I know and love. And so, yeah, certainly, those are emotionally fraught at times.” Judy agreed, saying “there is stuff you just feel you can’t write. It would be too distressing to write that stuff.”\n“Discomfort” was not a word not often used in interviews: only Lucas mentioned it as a significant dimension in editing Wikipedia pages, specifically in the context of settler-colonial violence. Despite this, discomfort is perhaps the most evident affective relation throughout the interviews and, this research finds, in how negative aspects of a place are discussed in Wikipedia articles. When we asked James if there was anything he wished people didn’t know about Tasmania, he answered,\n\nMaybe we’re just all used to being more transparent these days so there aren’t necessarily things we want to keep secret or quiet. Maybe it’s more that… you think the Port Arthur Massacre is too… we want to put it in proportion, maybe? But that’s not keeping it secret, that’s not keeping it down low. It’s putting it in proportion.\n\nThis is a different dynamic to one of outright exclusion. It is not wholeheartedly, as James says, a desire for secrecy or hiding. For James, it is a question of proportionality. But it’s interesting to consider James’ comments in light of the one sentence about the massacre in the Tasmania article. The brief description of the event is literally enveloped within a wider point about the (positive) gun reform laws that were implemented as a result of the tragedy. The picture of Port Arthur is captioned with a mention of its World Heritage status. This representation feels “in conversation” with–and maybe even acting counter to–the prominence James mentions. Gabriel’s discussion of how fraught it can be to engage with negative or painful aspects of a place is enlightening here. While a significant focus of Wikipedia research is on what is missing from Wikipedia (Redi et al. 2020; Adams et al. 2019; Martini 2023), this research finds that an equally important dimension is the discussions that are included but obscured or diminished. The role of affect is central.\n\nThe expression of complexity\nThere is a trend across the three articles studied for this report of using language to diminish the negativity of an aspect of an Australian place. This narrative strategy is consistently used in two specific areas across the three pages: discriminatory Australian government policy and violence against First Nations peoples. In both of these areas, the subject of who was responsible for discrimination and violence–white European colonists or white Australians–is obscured.\nThroughout the Australia page, discriminatory historical government policies are approached in two ways. The first is they are primarily described in the context of when they ended. The mention of the 1967 Referendum describes it as when “Indigenous Australians were fully included in the census.” There is another way of saying this: First Nations peoples were not included in the Census or counted as citizens before 1967. One of two mentions of the White Australia policy uses a similar device with the description focusing on the cessation of the White Australia policy and ensuing increased migration and cultural diversity. The language used in both of these examples emphasises the “positive step” of removing a racist policy, rather than engagement with the racist policy itself. The actor is also often absent in these sentences. For example, the Australia article states that “following Federation in 1901, a strengthening of the White Australia policy restricted further migration from these areas,” instead of “the Australian government strengthened the White Australia policy after Federation in 1901.”\nThese language devices are equally apparent in discussions of colonial and white Australian violence against First Nations peoples.\n\nFrom the Australia page:\n“Indigenous population declined for 150 years following European settlement, mainly due to infectious disease.”\n“[…] as settlement expanded, thousands of Indigenous people died in frontier conflicts while others were dispossessed of their traditional lands.”\nFrom the Tasmania page: \n“The [“Black-Line”] campaign failed and was abandoned seven weeks later, but by then Tasmania’s Aboriginal population had fallen to about 300 […]”\n\nThe actor, in these sentences, is absent. First Nations people “died,” their “population declined,” they were “dispossessed,” and their population “had fallen.” In every instance here, the language avoids stating what is inescapable: that white people killed, dispossessed and displaced First Nations people. The language distances white people from culpability and, in some instances, implies that the deaths of First Nations people following invasion or specific colonial campaigns was potentially correlative, not caused.\nNot all editors write about negative aspects of Australian place in this way: Jack and Lucas both gave specific examples of how they tried to counter what Lucas described as “whitewashy” language. The use of these language devices when describing negative aspects of Australian place are, however, relatively consistent across the analysed pages. This approach is at odds with Wikipedia policies, let alone the recommendations for First Nations inclusion in Wikipedia (Thorpe, Sentence & Booker 2023, Carlson & Rana 2024). As with the example of discomfort in the previous section, this is once again not wholesale absence. It is sanitisation: the inclusion of an aspect of an Australian place that cannot be completely omitted and must therefore be diminished, implied and shrouded in the passive voice.\n\n\nOmissions\nThe report has focused on the multitude of ways that aspects of a place are diminished or obscured. In the Katoomba page, there is an example of how an aspect of place can be excluded entirely. In 1957, Darug and Gundungurra peoples were forcibly removed from their homes in Garguree, also known as the Gully, a tract of land in the middle of the town of Katoomba. This removal is entirely absent from the Katoomba page, despite a paragraph describing Garguree, how it has been declared an Aboriginal Place5 and how it is an “area with a long history of occupation by the Gundungurra and Darug” peoples. The linked page on “Catalina Park” uses the same narrative devices identified earlier in the report in the Australia and Tasmania pages to imply the forced removal of people from their homes without stating it: “[the Darug and Gundungurra’s] relatively peaceful co-existence was shattered when the area was developed as a tourist park.”\nOnly one of the editors we spoke with was local to the Blue Mountains. Peter no longer edits Wikipedia that much: he started when he was working as a night security guard with a lot of time to kill and now he has other online mediums he focuses on. “I wish I’d known at the time a little bit more about the Gully,” Peter said. For non-locals editing the page, the description of Garguree probably wouldn’t raise any red flags.\nThe Katoomba page is about as non-contentious as it can get. There have been 696 edits and only 18 reverts in its 22-year history. The last comment on the “Talk” page was in 2007. The page appears straightforward. Yet, it is this “straightforward” page that contains one of the most significant omissions identified in this research. In some ways, the apparent non-contentiousness of the Katoomba page intensifies the effects of the omission, both on the article itself and, in all likelihood, across the Internet.\nTo engage with place in the Australian context is inevitably an engagement with settler-colonialism. This research concludes that First Nations histories, current experiences and voices remain marginalised on Wikipedia, reflecting the literature (Thorpe, Sentence & Booker 2023; Gallert et al. 2016; Bjork-James 2021). There are other omissions as well. Lucas argued that “basically any non-white experiences or non-dominant experiences are omitted.” Gabriel felt that Wikipedia was “quite a hostile space to marginalised people” and that there is “a really frustrating lack of space, I suppose, to me in all three elements: being a regional Australian; being queer; being disabled. None of them feel like something that Wikipedia really quite welcomes a lot of the time.”\nGender was also mentioned explicitly. Jack felt that the Australia page showed biases stereotypically involved with men and not much that reflected “the fact that there’s a lot of, like, female reinterpretations of history and stuff at the moment.” The fact that, despite attempted purposive recruitment, we only recruited two people who didn’t identify as men is, in itself, revealing.\nThere are equally omissions that result from the conceptualisation of space and place that underpin Wikipedia. The Wikipedia construction of space, identified in an earlier section, is not the only way to conceptualise space and place. In particular, the Wikipedia conceptualisation is inconsistent with many of the ways that First Nations people construct space. We are not the right people, and this report is not the right document in which to give a full and careful account of the many ways First Nations people construct space. But we can indicate how First Nations concepts of Country fail to register as “places” in the system.\nCountry contrasts with the Wikipedia notion of “place” in at least two ways. First, Country is not a “physical location” or “geographic feature”: it is “multi-dimensional—it consists of people, animals, plants, Dreamings; underground, earth, soils, minerals and waters, surface water, and air” (Rose 1996, 8). Second, Country is a local rather than a universal concept: “The fact of localised knowledge is itself Law. This system does not invite people to assume that they can or should know everything” (Rose 1996, 13). Since it is holistic and local, Country conflicts with Wikipedia’s physical/geographical and universal construction of space.\nAs a result, country is not represented as a place in Wikipedia, and does not figure in our dataset. The Wikipedia spatial equation, 1 place = 1 article, breaks down in Australia. The closest Wikipedia comes to representing country is in its articles about Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples and languages. For example, the articles about the Arrernte_people and Pitjantjatjara people indicate the extent and importance of their countries, but their countries are not represented as places in our dataset. In Wikipedia’s terms, these are articles not about places, but about peoples."

    "section": "Conclusion",
    "text": "Conclusion\nWikipedia has become a crucial site in which some of the core questions about Australian place and Australian identity are being categorised and debated. The acknowledgement and inclusion of First Nations peoples, knowledges and histories, settler-colonialism, republicanism: these are constantly categorised and discussed on Wikipedia. Rather than a fringe process that is far-removed from the concerns of Australians who don’t edit Wikipedia, these discussions are actively influencing how these aspects of Australian identity and place are represented and constructed in the wider knowledge ecosystem.\nWikipedia editors understand the importance of Wikipedia better than most. They understand that information on Wikipedia informs the wider knowledge landscape and the knowledge they include on Wikipedia may endure beyond them or even Wikipedia itself as a platform as a result. Universally, editors interviewed for this research believed in and care about the Wikipedia project: it is why they devote countless hours to the platform for free. It is, to an extent, why the contestations discussed in this report are so charged: Wikipedia editors believe in the project and understand how lasting the effect of the platform can be.\nAs demonstrated throughout this report, the Wikipedia representation of Australian places is anthropocentric and neocolonial. Rather than the result of a systematic approach or one particular factor, this representation emerges as the result of a complex amalgam of categorisation, editor practices, affective relations, Wikipedia policies and norms, as well as some of the conceptualisations that Wikipedia is founded on, such as a Western-centric understanding of space and place. What emerged from this research is more complex than the idea of gaps in what is and isn’t on Wikipedia: it is equally what is half-said or implied, what editors themselves find hard to say, and what isn’t understood as an omission because the framework Wikipedia is based on doesn’t work with ideas outside of Western epistemological traditions, such as Country.\nThis matters because how a place is represented on Wikipedia affects what is known about a place. It is important to illuminate these processes. When a place or information about a place is missing from Wikipedia or when a place seems to be mis-classified or even unclassifiable that doesn’t indicate an objective idea of their lack of importance or notability. What Wikipedia represents and doesn’t represent is the contingent result of negotiation. As shown in this report, Wikipedia editors are heterogeneous and have a broad range of views, approaches and practices. Editors are regularly discussing, debating, arguing and wrestling with how to represent the world from a range of possibilities. Sometimes those with the most endurance will win such arguments. Sometimes arguments don’t even happen because Wikipedia’s policies and culture exclude certain people and their knowledges outright (as is the case for many forms of First Nations knowledges).\nThe findings of this report have important implications for Australia. For Australian readers, the research provides insight into the strengths and weaknesses of Wikipedia articles about Australian places. For government policymakers, there are implications for education curricula, especially in incorporating critical digital literacy skills in using Wikipedia and understanding its role in the wider digital and knowledge ecosystems. Finally, for Wikimedia Foundation and Wikipedia editors there are significant implications for implementing the recommendations of Thorpe, Sentence and Booker (2023) and Carlson and Rana (2024) to improve policy and practice in relation to engagement with First Nations content and experience."

Wikipedia is a powerful producer of notability in Australia as it is in many nations, as we recently argued (Ford, Pietsch, and Tall 2023). Who does and does not have a Wikipedia biography matters.

Being well represented on Wikipedia makes a difference for one’s reputation and for the kinds of opportunities available to people in work and life.\nIn this, our first year of the wikihistories project, our focus is on how Wikipedia represents people. We ask how English Wikipedia represents Australians. Do we see the same trends in terms of gender and ethnicity so that globally studies of Wikipedia have identified? How well has English Wikipedia done over time to represent people in Australia? These are important questions but they are by no means easy to answer. In order to map Wikipedia’s representation of Australians over time, we first need to understand which biographies on Wikipedia refer to Australians. The question of who is recognized as an Australian is a question beset with complexities and politics before we even get to Wikipedia. On Wikipedia, further complexities arise.\nWho counts as Australian in Wikipedia and its sister-projects? How are Wikipedia articles or Wikidata items marked as ‘Australian’ by the system?

We have two primary aims: (1) to reveal the definition of ‘Australianess’ implicit in Wikipedia’s systems; (2) to assess how well Wikipedia represents the diversity of Australians. As we will see, Wikipedia works implicitly with numerous inconsistent definitions of ‘Australianness’, but it is nonetheless possible to make some reasonable observations about how well it represents the diversity of people who make up ‘Australia’.\nPeople can be represented in Wikipedia in many ways.

We show that it is possible to judge how well Wikipedia represents a certain group by counting pages, but that this method needs to be carefully planned and contextualised to account for local factors.\n\n\n\nHow do Wikipedians construct Australia online?"

    "text": "Analysis\n\nAustralianness\nIn this report, we do not seek to define what it means to be ‘Australian’. Instead, we aim to identify the ‘markers of Australianness’ that define what it means to be ‘Australian’ in Wikipedia. In Wikipedia, the primary marker of Australianness is membership of Category:Australian people. In Wikidata, no marker can be said to be primary, but the most frequent in our dataset is P27(Q408), a property meaning that a person is a ‘citizen’ of Australia. In both cases, we will see that there is a sharp divide between the way Wikipedians have defined the marker, and they way they have used it in practice.\nThere are two reasons we refrain from defining ‘Australian’ for ourselves. In the first case, our opinion is not at all important—what matters is Wikipedia’s opinion. In the second case, it is exceptionally difficult to define ‘Australian’ in a non-arbitrary way. In two dimensions, space and time, the concept of ‘Australian’ poses startling difficulties.\nIn space, it is difficult to judge whether a person is close enough to Australia to count as Australian. At one end of the specturm is someone who is born, lives and dies in Australia, such as Oodgeroo Noonuccal. There can be no dispute that such a person is Australian. At the other end of the spectrum is someone who has only a passing cultural or economic connection to Australia, such as Steve Wozniak, one of the more surprising members of Category:Australian people. Then there is the problem of the diaspora. Are the children of Australians Australian, even if born overseas? If, like Rupert Murdoch, you leave Australia and renounce your citizenship, do you remain Australian? There may be easy answers to these questions in specific contexts, for example, when calculating a person’s tax liability or entitlement to vote, but in the context of an encyclopaedic project like Wikipedia, they cannot be easily resolved.\nIn time, it is difficult to judge when in history it becomes reasonable to describe someone as ‘Australian’. Humans first arrived in Australia some 60,000 years ago, but they did not call the continent ‘Australia’. The term ‘Terra Australis’ (‘Southern Land’) was coined by 16th-century Europeans. At this time, ‘Terra Australis’ was merely a proposal, as no European had visited either Australia or Antarctica. In the end, neither Australia nor Antarctica matched European expectations about the ‘Southern Land’, though Australia, being the first that Europeans visited, acquired the name. New South Wales was invaded by the British in 1788. The term ‘Australia’ was substituted for ‘Terra Australis’ in 1813. The colonies of Australia federated into a single Commonwealth in 1901. The resulting Commonwealth of Australia only achieved full independence from Britain in 1988. The problem of time is compounded by geology. In the course of Australia’s human occuption, the very landmass has altered considerably. Only 10,000 years ago, the Australian mainland, Papua New Guinea and Tasmania formed a single contiguous landmass that geologers call Sahul. Are all the people who occupied Sahul at any point in time ‘Australians’? Or can only residents or citizens of the country ‘Australia’ be so named? Like space, time wreaks havoc on the category ‘Australian’.\nThe editors of Wikipedia and Wikidata grapple with both these problems. The result is a kind of categorical anarchy, where different parts of the system work with different concepts of ‘Australianess’ and apply different criteria of connection. It is for this reason that we talk of ‘markers of Australianness’ in Wikipedia. How do these markers work?\n\nIn the category system\nThe primary marker of Australianness in Wikipedia, as we have seen, is membership of Category:Australian people. The category offers simple criteria for membership:\n\nThis category lists notable Australian-born people, or people who identify themselves as Australian.\n\nA user who clicks on the hyperlink ‘Australian’ will be taken to the Wikipedia page for Australia, which defines Australia as follows:\n\nAustralia, officially the Commonwealth of Australia, is a sovereign country comprising the mainland of the Australian continent, the island of Tasmania, and numerous smaller islands.\n\nThese definitions seem to offer a strong answer to the problems of space and time. ‘Australia’ is the ‘Commonwealth of Australia’, the sovereign state that has existed since 1901. In space, a person must be ‘born’ in Australia, or ‘identify themselves’ as a member of the country. In time, Australia is the Commonwealth of Australia, and so has only existed since 1901.\nThe problem is, this explicit definition does not at all describe the contents of Category:Australian people. In the spatial dimension, the category includes living people such as Steve Wozniak and Darrell Duffie who were neither born in Australia nor identify themselves with it. In the time dimension, the category includes many historical figures who long preceded the Commonwealth of Australia, such as Bennelong, Mary Reiby, Robert Lowe and Louisa Atkinson. Finally, it lists thousands of entities that aren’t people, such as First Ever, the sportswear manufacturer, and ‘Hand on Your Heart’, the 1989 single by Kylie Minogue. How has Category:Australian people expanded to include so many pages that contradict its own explicit definition?\nThe answer lies in the category’s size. When editors include articles in Category:Australian people, they do not necessarily do so intentionally. Category:Australian people is the root node of a vast category graph. The editor who categorised Steve Wozniak as a staff member of the University of Technology Sydney was probably unaware that they were thereby categorising Wozniak as an ‘Australian person’. The category for academic staff at UTS lies several layers deep in the category graph, 4 steps away from the root (Figure 2). Perhaps an editor may quibble that a person who works at UTS is not necessarily ‘from Sydney’, but in the present state of the category graph, there is no other way to mark a staff member of UTS. The category graph is strictly hierarchical. A subcategory cannot be removed from its parent category for the sake of a single page.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: The category for UTS staff lies four steps away from Category:Australian people\n\n\n\n\n\nCategory:Australian people has 9,492 subcategories, many of which are even farther from the root than the staff of UTS. We can get a sense of how vast this structure is by taking diameter of the category graph. In this case, the diameter is 11, which means that the most distant subcategory of Category:Australian people is 11 steps away. Such distant nodes are called ‘eccentric’ in graph theory. In this case, the most distant subcategory truly is eccentric: Category:Custard (band) compilation albums does not include articles about ‘Australian people’ at all, but about indie rock records. This case is extreme. The case of UTS staff members is more typical. If we consider all the articles that have been placed in Category:Australian people or its subcategories, we find that the subcategories used are on average 3.17 steps away from the root, with a standard deviation of 0.95. In the typical case, when an editor adds an article to an ‘Australian people’ subcategory, the subcategory is 2-4 steps away from the root. It seems likely that editors are mostly unaware of the category graph as a whole. Editors work locally, trying to find the best categorisations for their articles, while Wikipedia’s systems work globally, enforcing the hierarchical logic of the enormous and usually invisible category graph.\nThere is thus a contradiction between the global and local logics of the category graph. Frequently, the category graph also contradicts the actual content of the encyclopaedia. First Ever is categorised as an ‘Australian person’ even though the text of the article identifies it as ‘an Australian manufacturing company’.1 These contradictions breed a pervasive categorical anarchy. Seen from afar, Wikipedia is extremely lax about who or what counts as ‘Australian’. A person—or even not a person—can be categorised as ‘Australian’ for whatever reason seems reasonable in the local context. Such laxity is probably necessary to Wikipedia’s encyclopaedic ambitions—how else could the vague concept of ‘Australian person’ ever find a place in Wikipedia? Wikidata is a different beast. Rather than a collection of textual articles that can speak for themselves, it is a database of structured facts (called ‘claims’) which are supposed to provide a reliable machine-readable knowledge graph. Can categorical anarchy prevail in such a system?\n\n\nIn Wikidata\nWikidata’s contributors are well aware of the difficulties of space and time. The simplest way to mark someone as ‘Australian’ in Wikidata is to give ‘Australia’ as the person’s ‘country of citizenship’ (P27). Our dataset contains 47,445 ‘Australian citizens’ according to P27. A glance at the Talk page for P27 reveals that Wikidata’s editors are well aware of the problems with trying to categorised people as ‘Australian’ in any stable way.\nThe user Ghouston clearly articulates the problem of time in a post from 2018:\n\nIt’s not easy. Australian citizenship didn’t exist before 1949, yet Australia as a federation has existed since 1901 and the term “Australian” was in use in the 19th century. To say that the United Kingdom was created in 1927 or the Netherlands perhaps in 1815 or 1945 or China in 1949 is to ignore much of the history of these countries as states.\n\nTwo years later, Ghouston provides additional sources and mentions a possible solution:\n\nSeparate items for citizenships and nationalities have been proposed previously. Perhaps it would help. The term “Australian” for people living in Australia was already used in the 19th century, before Australia had even been federated as a state, e.g., [2]. According to [3], Australia started issuing passports after federation, and didn’t even restrict it to British subjects until 1938, but it seems that passports were not used much prior to WW1, and there was a more flexible attitude to nationality.\n\nAt the time of writing, there is no Wikidata property for ‘nationality’. Instead, the property of citizenship is limited according to the ‘inception’ (P571) of the given country and the death date of the given person. The start date of Australia is given as 1 January 1901 in Wikidata. If a person is assigned Australian citizenship in Wikidata, and their death date occurs before 1 January 1901, then a warning appears in their Wikidata page. At the time of writing, the Wikidata item for colonial poet Charles Harpur contains such a warning (Figure 3). Harpur, who proudly described himself as as ‘An Australian’ in newspaper publications from the 1830s, died in 1868.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Citzenship warning banner for Charles Harpur\n\n\n\nThis solution combines flexibility with clarity.\n\nFlexibility: It is possible to mark the ‘Australianness’ of Charles Harpur and others who have been identified as Australian throughout history.\nClarity: Wikidata provides clear guidance to its contributors through the warning banner. As far as Wikidata is concerned, Australian citizenship was available to people from 1901.\n\nThe price of this clarity and flexibility is inconsistency and quixotism.\n\nInconsistency: Wikidata flatly contradicts itself as far as historical figures like Charles Harpur are concerned. Was Harpur a citizen of Australia or not? Wikidata also contradicts, or at least brings into question, its own definition of ‘citizenship’. Wikidata defines citizenship (P27) thus: ‘the object is a country that recognizes the subject as its citizen’ This definition is not reflected in P27’s rules: all that is required is that the country exists prior to the supposed citizen’s birth date. If Harpur were posthumously recognised as a citizen by the Commonwealth of Australia, this could not currently be reflected in the database. The warning banner would remain.\nQuixotism: As Ghouston himself observes, Australia did not have an official system for conferring citizenship until 1949. By seeming to choose 1 January 1901 as earliest permitted date, Wikidata has invented its own concept of Australian citizenship. Is this quixotism consistent with Wikidata’s self-description as a ‘secondary database, collecting structured data’? Does Wikidata collect structured data, or does it structure collected data?\n\nWikimedians are aware of the difficulty of time. The state of P27 suggests that they are content for the minute to leave the difficulty unresolved.\nThe difficulty of space is less clearly articulated on the talk page for P27 (‘country of citizenship’). Perhaps this is because the concept ‘citizenship’ presupposes a deep and publicly sanctioned connection between the person and the country. In a sense, Wikidata delegates the question of a person’s spatial connection to Australia, by recording when a person appears in a known database of Australians. These databases make their own decisions about the ‘Australianness’ of their subjects. The Dictionary of Australian Biography, for example, does not required its subjects to be Australian at all, as explained in their FAQs:\n\nDo you have to be an Australian to be in the ADB?\nThe ADB includes anyone who has made a significant contribution to the Australian nation.\n\nThe AusStage database, meanwhile, records any person who ‘contributed’ in some way to a theatrical performance in Australia, or to an overseas performance of an Australian theatrical work. AusStage and the Australian Dictionary of Biography provide very broad markers of Australianness. By contrast, the Re-Member database of the Parliament of Victoria provides a stricter marker of a person’s Australianness. To appear in Re-Member, a person must be a former member of the Parliament of Victoria. We identified dozens of other databases that indicated ‘Australianess’ in Wikidata. When a Wikimedian links a person to the Australian Dictionary of Biography (P1907), AusStage (P8292), Re-Member (P8633), or some other database of Australians, the linked database will encode a different answer to the question ‘Who Counts as Australian?’\n\n\n\nGender\nAlthough it is impossible to provide a unitary definition for ‘Australian’ in Wikidata and Wikipedia, we have shown that it is possible to derive a large list of people who are marked as ‘Australian’ in some way across the encyclopaedia and database. What is the composition of this list? We begin with gender.\nTo determine the gender of a person in our dataset, we rely on the Wikidata property P21:Sex or gender. In our dataset, nearly all records have a sex or gender recorded (Figure 4). Only 6 records lack a P21 statement about their sex or gender.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSex or Gender Label\nTotal\n\n\n\n\nfa’afafine\n1\n\n\nfemale\n16560\n\n\ngenderfluid\n6\n\n\ngenderqueer\n1\n\n\nintersex\n3\n\n\nintersex woman\n1\n\n\nmale\n66375\n\n\nnon-binary\n28\n\n\ntrans man\n3\n\n\ntrans woman\n27\n\n\ntransgender\n2\n\n\nNA\n6\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Gender breakdown of the Australian biographies dataset\n\n\n\n\nWeathington and Brubaker (2023) have strongly critiqued Wikidata’s representation of sex and gender, observing that “Queer identities are recorded in a database in clunky, inaccurate, or self-contradictory ways” (p. 2) and that the database ignores the individual’s right to determine their own sexual presentation. Nonetheless, we are compelled to rely on Wikidata’s representation of individuals’ sex and/or gender if we wish to assess its representation of human diversity in Australia. To this end, we categorise our dataset into three broad groups: male, female and trans, non-binary or intersex. While we may assume that most of those marked as ‘male’ or ‘female’ are cis-male or -female, we cannot determine this from the available data, and so opt for the less specific ‘male’ and ‘female’.\nFemale biographies are clearly under-represented among Wikipedia’s Australian articles. (Figure 4) shows all the articles in the dataset, categorised by their gender on Wikidata. The gap between male and female biographies appears to have remained constant over time (Figure 5). Viewing the data on a logarithmic scale emphasises the parallel track of male and female biographies in Australian Wikipedia, while also allowing us to visualise the similar growth of trans, non-binary or intersex biographies (Figure 6).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5: Growth of the Australian biographies dataset over time, broken down by gender\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6: Growth of the Australian biographies dataset over time, broken down by gender, on a log scale to compare growth rates for each gender.\n\n\n\n\n\nNot only are male, female and LGBTQI+ Australians represented in different numbers in the encyclopaedia, they are represented by different words. To show this, we downloaded the introductions of each article in the encyclopaedia, and used the tf-idf statistic to determine which words were most distinctive for each group of biographies. Which words tend to appear more often in the introductions of articles about male, female and trans, non-binary or intersex Australians?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7: Comparing the introductions of each article in the Australian biographies dataset, using the tf-idf metric to reveal the most distinctive words in the introductions for each gender grouping.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7 discloses two significant patterns:\n\nExplicit marking of non-Male genders: First, Wikipedia articles are more likely to explicitly mention the sex or gender of a female or trans, non-binary or intersex Australian. The high tf-idf score for “women’s” in biographies of Females probably reflects the fact that female sporting teams often have “women’s” in their names. Thus Sam Kerr is said to represent Australian in the “national women’s team”, while Harry Kewell was simply a member of “the Australian national team”. The situation for trans, non-binary or intersex Australians is even more marked. ‘Transgender’, ‘sex’ and ‘woman’ all appear as distinctive terms in the introductions of Wikipedia biographies in this group.\nDominance of sport and entertainment: Across all three gender categories, sport and entertainment are dominant themes. The male biographies seem less likely to describe entertainers than those in the other categories. Unsuprisingly, the trans, non-binary or intersex biographies seem more likely to discuss social affairs, ‘activist’ and ‘rights’ being prominent terms in the introductions of these biographies.\n\nThe data support the views of Weathington and Brubaker (2023). In Australian Wikipedia, maleness is the unmarked default. Female and especially trans, non-binary or intersex Australians are described using terms such as ‘women’ or ‘transgender’; there is no need to explicitly mention that a person is male or cisgender. In the case of trans, non-binary or intersex people, this explicit marking of gender goes a step further. Australians in this group are likely to be described as ‘activists’, presumbly on gender issues. Biographies of trans, non-binary or intersex Australians problematise gender in a manner that biographies of male Australians do not.\nWikipedia’s defaulting to maleness probably reflects the linguistic habits of broader Australian society, but it could also be exacerbated by the encylopaedia’s obsession with sport and entertainment. Both sport and entertainment are highly gendered fields. Men and women compete in gendered competitions such as the soccer or cricket World Cups and receive gendered commendations such as Best Actress at the Academy Awards. While male Australians may dominate non-male Australians in fields such as politics, business and the arts, these fields are not so explicitly gendered. Sam Kerr may indeed be captain of the “women’s national team,” but it makes no sense to describe Vanessa Hudson as the CEO of a “women’s corporation.” Sport and entertainment are fields that reflect society’s deepest-held and most immoveable convictions. Wikipedia’s powerful focus on these fields may place the encyclopaedia behind other parts of Australia in the evolution of non-gendered language.\nFigure 8 suggests a silver lining to this story of the gender gap. Although male Australians continue to greatly outnumber female and trans, non-binary or intersex on Wikipedia, many of the male biographies are of low quality. In fact, if we consider only C-Class articles and above, the proportion of female biographies rises from 19.9% to 33.0%. It appears that editors have devoted considerably more effort to creating pages about men than about women or people of other genders, but that editors devote more effort on average to maintaining pages about non-male Australians.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8: Page assessment class by gender in the Australian biographies dataset\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIndigeneity\nThe distinction between ‘settler’ and ‘indigenous’ Australian pervades Wikipedia in a cryptic way. Race and ethncity are portrayed in a lopsided manner in Wikipedia, much like gender. In English Wikipedia, Mandiberg (2023) observes, people are not officially classified by ‘race’, but whiteness is assumed as a default, and a person is far more likely to be categorised by their ethnic or national origin if they are non-white.\nThere is no explicit category for ‘settler’ or ‘white’ Australian. There are categories for Category:Immigrants to Australia and Category:Australian people of European Descent, but these are applied only haphazardly to indicate the ‘settler’ status of a minority of Australians. A good example is Tony Abbott. According to his Wikipedia biography, he was born in London to English parents, and ‘migrated to Australia at the age of two’. His page is nearly 20 years old, and has been edited more than 4000 times.. Nonetheless, no-one has thought to categorise him either as an ‘immigrant’ or as an Australian ‘of European descent’. Extending Mandiberg’s arguments, we can hypothesise that ‘settler’ status is assumed in Australian Wikipedia, and a person’s whiteness or migrant status is considered unremarkable if they are British. We substantiate this hypothesis below.\nThere may be no single category for ‘settler’ or ‘white’ Australian, but there is certainly a single overarching category for Indigenous Australian people. Within this category, editors are instructed to sub-categorise Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians as precisely as possible (Figure 9). These subcategories fall into three main kinds:\n\nSub-categories for mob or language group, e.g. Category:Pitjantjatjara people.\nSub-categories for occupation, e.g. Category:Indigenous Australian linguists (Curiously, neither guide nor tracker is considered an occupation in this scheme.)\nMiscellaneous subcategories, including Category:Members of the Stolen Generations, Category:Last known speakers of an Aboriginal language, Category:Indigenous Australian feminists and Category:Australian Aboriginal elders.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 9: Template:Category diffuse instructs editors to categorise Indigenous Australian People more precisely\n\n\n\nCategory:Indigenous Australian people is actually nested quite deeply within the Australian category graph (Figure 10). Figure 10 may at first be confusing to Australian readers, because it is common in Australia to refer to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people as “First Nations Australians.” In English Wikipedia’s category graph, however, the term “First Nations” is used the Canadian sense.2 In this instance, Wikipedia’s category graph is potentially incendiary, because it appears to imply there is no special connection between Indigenous Australians and the continent to which they are indigenous. The overarching Category:Australian people by ethnic or national origin is organised predominantly by continent or region. There are sub-categories for Australians of African, Asian, Carribean, Latin American, Middle Eastern, North American and Oceanian descent. There is no category for “Australians of Australian descent”, nor is Category:Australian people of Indigenous Australian descent included as a subcategory of Category:Australian people of Oceanian descent.3 By contrast, Category:Australians of First Nations descent is included as a subcategory of Category:Australian people of Canadian descent, which is itself a subcategory of Category:Australians of North American descent. In this local portion of the graph, the link between First Nations Canadians and Canada is formally encoded. The link between Indigenous Australian people and Australia is not. A naïve reader of the graph (such as a computer program) might erroneously conclude that First Nations Australians have the same relationship to Australia as Indigenous Australians.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 10: Local portion of the category graph for Category:Australian people, showing how Category:Indigenous Australian people fits into the system\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Wikipedia’s defence, the indigeneity of Indigenous Australians is encoded in other ways. In this local portion of the graph, a human can see from the labels of Category:Australian people of Indigenous Australian descent and Category:Indigenous Australian people that people in these categories are indigenous to Australia. Looking beyond this local portion of the graph, we can also see that Category:Indigenous peoples of Australia is a subcategory of Category:Indigenous peoples of Oceania. It is nonetheless curious that the local portion of the graph that classifies Australians by ‘ethnic or national origin’ should de-emphasise Category:Indigenous Australian people.\nThe situation is different for other countries in English Wikipedia. Other settler-colonial countries include categories for their own indigenous peoples directly beneath the super-category for people by ethnic or national origin. For example, Category:Indigenous Mexicans is a direct subcategory of Category:Mexican people by ethnic or national origin, while the analogous Australian category, Category:Indigenous Australian people, is two steps deeper in the graph. A similar pattern holds for other settler-colonial states. New Zealand, New Caledonia, South Africa and the United States all include top-level categories for their Indigenous peoples under the people by ethnic or national origin super-category.\nThere is a second notable difference between the category graphs for Australia and Mexico. We have seen that Australia’s Category:Australian people of indigenous peoples descent is used to classify people who are indigenous anywhere. The analogous Mexican category, Category:Mexican people of indigenous peoples descent, is used exclusively to classify indigenous peoples of Mexico itself. Brazil and Argentina similarly reserve their ‘indigenous peoples’ category for their own indigenous peoples.\nAustralia is not entirely alone. The subgraph for Category:Japanese people by ethnic or national origin also obfuscates the indigeneity of Japan’s indigenous peoples. There is no explicit category for Japanese people ‘of indigenous descent’. Instead, Category:Japanese Ainu people is included as a subcategory of Category:Japanese people of East Asian descent. In this way, the link between Ainu people and the region is locally marked in the category graph, but one must look elsewhere in the graph to discover that Ainu people are indigenous to Japan.\nIt is clear that quantifying indigenous representation in Wikipedia is a fraught exercise. Scholars are well advised to carefully consider how indigeneity is understood in different parts of the world, and then to pay close attention to the particular structure of ethnic and national classification in any particular part of Wikipedia.\nNonetheless, we can use the category graph to estimate the number of biographies of Indigenous Australians in Wikipedia. Figure 11 suggests that in recent years, Wikipedians may have begun to address the representation gap between Indigenous and settler Australians. Figure 11 shows the proportion of biographies in our dataset that fall within Category:Indigenous Australian people. The representation gap for Indigenous Australians is not so stark as the representation gap for non-male Australians. According to the Australian Census, the number of Indigenous Australians grew from 2.5% of Australia’s population to 3.2% between 2011 and 2021. In our estimate, the proportion of Indigenous biographies in Category:Australian people, went from 2.29% on January 1 2011 to 2.05% on January 1 2021. At the time of our data collection, the proportion had risen again to 2.16%. Although comparison with the census would suggest that Wikipedia under-represents Indigenous Australians, the representation gap is currently narrowing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 11: Proportion of Indigenous biographies in the Australian biographies dataset over time.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs for gender see 8, we can consider how indicators of page quality alter the picture. Figure 12 does indeed suggest that the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander biographies repeat the same pattern as for gender. Although biographies of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians are less numerous than biographies of other Australians, they are generally of higher quality according to Wikipedia’s own quality assessment standards. If we consider only articles of C-Class and above, then the proportion of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander biographies in the dataset climbs from 2.2% to 3.7%.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 12: Page assessment class broken down by membership of Category:Indigenous Australian people\n\n\n\n\n\nThese results do need to be taken with a grain of salt. As Thorpe, Sentance, and Booker (2023) show, Wikipedia’s articles on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people are dominated by ‘settler narratives’, and typically rely on public-domain sources that reflect the values of Nineteenth-Century British colonists. Our analysis of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander representation in Wikipedia must therefore be supplemented with more detailed analysis of the sources and rhetoric of the articles themselves.\n\n\nHistorical period\nThe final aspect of human diversity we consider is historical period. How are people from different periods in Australia’s history represented in the encyclopaedia? To estimate this, we rely on date of birth data from Wikidata. Wikidata records a date of birth for 70,741 of the articles in our dataset. This data is displayed in Figure 13, which shows the number of biographies in the dataset according to the decade in which the person was born.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 13: Articles in the Australian biographies dataset broken down by the decade in which the subject of the biography was born.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 13 displays the obvious colonial bias in the dataset. There are very few biographies of any persons prior to British colonisation of Australia. This is partly a product of our focus on biography. There is very little biographical data available about individual persons living in Australia prior to 1788. But this colonial bias also represents a darker side of Australian history. In the first half of the Nineteenth Century, the majority of Australia’s population was probably indigenous. Butlin (1994) estimates that that colonial population only overtook the indigenous population in the 1840s. According to his estimates, the population of Australia hovered around 600,000 from around 1800 until the 1840s, because the number of new migrants into the colony was roughly equal to the decline of the indigenous population due to British depradations (1994, 212). In Figure 13, this history is obscured. A naive interpreter of the figure might assume that Australia’s population grew continuously from the British invasion of 1788 until the present. In fact, there was a sharp decline in Australia’s population in the first two decades of settlement, followed by a period of relative stagnation.\nWe can conclude that Wikipedia’s Australian biographies broadly reflect the growth of colonial society in Australia since 1788. How closely does Wikipedia reflect this growth? Figure 14 compares our dataset to historical population growth figures from the Australian Bureau of Statistics (2016). This data records the growth of colonial society, because Indigenous Australians were excluded from the census until 1961. From this data, we calculate the colonial population growth for each decade from the 1780s to the 2010s. For example, in the 1810s, Australia’s population grew by 21,977 people. We then find the number of Wikipedia biographies for people whose date of birth lies in this decade, as in Figure 13, and calculate this as a percentage of the Australian population growth in that decade. For example, there are 662 biographies for people born in the 1810s in our dataset, which is equal to 3% of the colonial population growth for that decade. The two datasets are not perfectly comparable, because our data does not account for when a person migrated to Australia, but Figure 14 nonetheless clearly shows the historical bias of Wikipedia’s Australian biographies. There are many more articles per person in the early years of the colony compared to later on in Australia’s colonial history. Since the 1850s, the historical coverage of Australian Wikipedia biographies has been more equal.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 14: Number of articles in Australian biographies dataset compared to historical population growth statistics from the Australian Bureau of Statistics (2016).\n\n\n\n\n\nThis analysis by Historical Period complements our earlier analysis of Gender and Indigeneity in the dataset. Generally speaking, Wikipedia’s Australian biographies reflect the male-dominated settler narrative of Australia’s colonisation, though there are important caveats to this general finding."

    "section": "Conclusion",
    "text": "Conclusion\nIn the report above we’ve articulated how Wikipedia represents Australians according to multiple mechanisms for categorizing and defining Australianness in Wikipedia and Wikidata’s datasets and we’ve argued that Wikipedia’s datafied representations highlight the problems of taking any overly simplistic view of Wikipedia’s biases. The majority of quantitative studies of Wikipedia’s biases examine its trajectories in terms of global trends – for example, in the representation of women and men, Westerners and non-Westerners. And yet, what we’ve shown in this report is that in taking a national perspective we recognize the contingencies and contexts that significantly enhance such analyses.\nWe hope, then, that this study reveals the importance of examining Wikipedia at a local (national) level. Only by thinking about and with the container of the nation, can the specificities, paradoxes, and discontinuities of Wikipedia’s representation become evident. At a national level, we can start to understand how Wikipedia has represented women over time and how such representations compare to global trends. At a national level, we can ask new questions about people in ethnic categories that are particularly discriminated against and question whether the categorization norms are appropriate given alternative models that other nations have followed in relation to similar categories. At a national level, we can examine historical biases in the context of our knowledge about stories that the nation tells itself about who it is and where it comes from.\nIn this the methods of the discipline of history are helpful. Contingency, embeddedness, and human agency are central to the methods of history. Characteristics like identity or notability are not eternal, static, or natural. Although institutions such as nation states are hugely powerful and condition the experiences and behaviour of people, humans crucially have the power to act on and in the world. But they do so embedded in contexts that are always specific, both temporally and geographically. Moreover, historians, approach people in the midst of things: living in changing times and acting as best they can with the tools they have available to them (Pietsch and Flanagan 2020).\nWe show that it is possible to estimate how well Wikipedia represents the diversity of a given nation using page-level metadata. Counting pages is a good starting point, and can reveal representation gaps that Wikimedians can then attempt to redress. But counting pages is a difficult exercise, and must be performed sensitively. Rather than simply counting people with the most popular or prominent categories, we argue that is critical to also examine the semantics of the category structure itself. How might the dataset shift and morph depending on different semantic terms? How does the way in which categories are structured suggest a particular perspective about national identity? How is what the nation values reflected in the characteristics of those who tend to have a Wikipedia page?"

    "text": "Appendix: Data\nThe code to generate this report is contained in two files in the wikihistories reports Github repository:\n\nwho-counts-lib.R contains all the functions to import the data\nwho-counts-data.R combines the functions to import the full dataset. This script can be run with USE_CACHE &lt;- TRUE to import the data from the saved files for this report, or USE_CACHE &lt;- FALSE to regenerate the data afresh from Wikipedia and Wikidata\n\nAll the source code for the analysis is included in this report, and can be viewed on Github at who-counts.qmd.\n\nWikipedia’s category system\nFrom its inception, Wikipedia has provided a category system to ‘group together pages on similar subjects’, and provide useful ‘navigational links to pages in Wikipedia’. Wikipedia’s categories form a vast and complex tree. A category may contain infintely many subcategories, and those subcategories may themselves belong to infinitely many supercategories. Nearly all Wikipedia articles are categorised, partly due to the work of a task group and patrol whose job is to hunt down any uncategorised articles.\nIn this context, the first place we looked for biographies of Australian people on Wikipedia was Category:Australian people, which ‘lists notable Australian-born people, or people who identify themselves as Australian’. This category contains 99,626 articles, but not all are biographies. In the first case, there are many articles about groups of Australian people, e.g. Aboriginal Victorians or Australian Chamber Orchestra. In the second case, Category:Australian people is a vast category, with 9,492 subcategories. In the trackless expanse of these subcategories, some unexpected articles make their way into Category:Australian people, such as the classic glam rock album Living in the ’70s. We explain the ‘eccentricity’ of the category graph when we analyse Wikipedia’s definition of Australianness below. For now, we simply describe our method for filtering all the non-biographies out of Category:Australian people.\nTo filter out the non-biographies, we rely on Wikidata. We fetch the Wikidata item for each article in Category:Australian people, and check to see if it has property P31(Q5), ‘instance of:human’. While the possession of P31(Q5) is not a perfect signal that an article is a biography, we find that this criterion filters out nearly all the non-biographies. Applying this criterion, we identify 81,493 biographical articles in Category:Australian people.\n\n\nWikidata’s query service\nWikidata provides an alternative method for finding Australian biographies: its query service. Using the query service, it is possible to search for Wikidata items that possess given properties. If these Wikidata items have a corresponding Wikipedia page, the link can be automatically retrieved.\nIt is more complex to find the ‘Australians’ in Wikidata than in Wikipedia. Wikipedia provides a single master-category for ‘Australian people’. Wikidata does not. Instead, Wikidata can mark a person as ‘Australian’ in two main ways:\n\nIt can explicitly link a person to Australia (Q408) through properties such as citizenship (P27), place of birth (P19) or place of death (P570); or\nIt can implicitly link a person to Australia by identifying them in a database of Australians, such as the Dictionary of Australian Biography (P1907), Indigenous Australia (P9246), or Convict Records of Australia (P9919)\n\nWe queried Wikidata by 45 such properties suggesting Australianness. Using these properties, we were able to identify 85,773 Wikidata items representing Australian people. Of these Wikidata items, 63,692 items had a corresponding Wikipedia article.\nThe two datasets overlap substantially, but not completely (Figure 15). There are thousands of biographical articles in Category:Australian people whose Wikidata items do not clearly identify them as ‘Australian’. Likewise, there are hundreds of Wikidata items whose corresponding Wikipedia articles do not appear in Category:Australian people, even though the Wikidata item has P31(Q5), ‘instance of:human’, and also contains one or more ‘markers of Australianness’.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDataset\nNumber of Articles\n\n\n\n\nPerson only found by querying Wikidata\n1520\n\n\nPerson only found in Category:Australian people\n19321\n\n\nPerson found in both datasets\n62172\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 15: There is substantial, but incomplete overlap between the biographies in the two datasets\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMetadata\nWe combine our two datasets into a single larger dataset of 83,013 articles. To enable analysis of these articles, we then enrich them with three kinds of metadata:\n\nUsing the Wikidata Action API, we find each person’s dates, birthplace and gender.\nUsing the Wikipedia Action API, we download the introduction of each article for text analysis.\nUsing the XTools API, we download page usage data for each page, including the page creation date, assessment class (e.g. Good, Featured), pageviews and number of edits."

For instance, Category:British people of Australian descent is a subcategory of Category:British people of Oceanian descent.
