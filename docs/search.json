Are they the most contentious articles in the dataset? That question is impossible to answer by such a simple measure.\n\n\n\n\nSome Wikipedia pages are more controversial than others. Wikipedia contributors have argued for years over whether Pavolva was invented in Australia or New Zealand. Other pages inspire little debate. It is not easy to locate or rank contentious articles using computerised methods. Contention can take many forms: editors might ‘revert’ (i.e. undo) one another’s edits; they might debate topics in-depth on Wikipedia Talk pages; they might abuse one another ‘off-wiki’; they might accuse one another of misconduct, and be subject to administrative redress. For simplicity’s sake, we focus just on the first manifestation of contention, when Wikipedians ‘revert’ or undo each others’ edits.\nIn Figure 1, we have attempted to find 10 highly contentious Places using a simple metric. The figure shows the 10 Australian places that have been edited at least 50 times, with the highest ratio of ‘reverted’ edits to human edits. For example, the little article on Barmah National Park has only had text added to it 70 times, but more than half (39) of those edits have been reverted! The reason is a long-running dispute over whether horses in the national park should be considered as ‘wild’ or ‘feral’. This debate reflects a deep anxiety in Australia about the moral value of European settlement. Some White Australians see the horses (or ‘brumbies’) as part of Australia’s European heritage. Others view them as an invasive species that represent the destructive history of European colonisation. Other examples in Figure 1 reflect similarly emotional conflicts in Australian society. The page for Howard Springs was subject to an ‘edit war’ during the pandemic, when one editor wished to redefine the local COVID-19 Quarantine Facility as a “Concentration Camp.” The page for Airport Drive, meanwhile, was subject to an altogether less emotional dispute: the editors could not agree which other roads intersect with this Melbourne motorway.\nAs these few examples demonstrate, Australian places can inspire many kinds of dispute: disputes about Australia’s colonisation, disputes about civil liberties, disputes about arid matters of geographical fact. Sometimes apparent disputes are actually simple vandalism, as in the page for Giru, Queensland whose Infobox has been vandalised numerous times to place the city “1,283 km (797 mi) NNW of Miley Cyrus.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: The Cebuano and Swedish Wikipedias have many articles written by a software program, lsjbot. Swedish Wikipedians have in recent years deleted most of lsjbot’s articles, but the small community of Cebuano editors in the Philippines have not done so in their encyclopaedia.\n\n\n\n\n\nWikipedia is available in more than 300 languages. You might expect that English Wikipedia would have the most articles about Australian places—but you’d be wrong. Figure 2 shows that Cebuano Wikipedia has by far the largest number of articles about Australian places. Tens of thousands of Australian places, such as Molecap Hill, Dindum Island and Mount Finlayson Range, have articles only in Cebuano Wikipedia. Why is this?\nIt is not because the speakers of the Cebuano language in Philippines are obsessed with Australian geography. It is because virtually the whole Cebuano Wikipedia has been written by a bot, lsjbot, programmed by Sverker Johansson, a Swedish computational linguist. lsjbot was historically responsible for a large portion of Swedish Wikipedia too, and despite efforts by Swedish Wikipedians to delete its formulaic articles, lsjbot is still responsible for many Swedish articles about obscure Australian places, including Dawes National Park and Lake Baker. The story is similar on Egyptian Arabic Wikipedia. Egyptian Arabic Wikipedia contains thousands of articles about Australian places because of one editor, Mahar Asaad Baker, who describes in a published booklet how they wrote 1.6 million articles by downloading data from Wikidata and converting it into Masri text for the site.\nHow is it possible for simple software to generate so many factually accurate articles about Australian places? Read any article by lsjbot, and you will see how thoroughly geography has been ‘datified’ in the 21st century. A global database, geonames.org records basic data about millions of place names. lsjbot browses geonames.org to find places without Wikipedia articles. When it finds a missing article, lsjbot extracts basic information from geonames.org, such as the type, name, and co-ordinates of the place. The bot then combines the basic information with publicly-available climate data from NASA Earth Observations datasets, and uses this climatic map to determine the place’s Köppen climate classification.1 lsjbot takes advantage of geospatial data to create articles about the earth’s physical geography. We will see that the human editors of English Wikipedia describe places more humanistically.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: This shows all the types of places that have at least 50 articles about them in English and Cebuano Wikipedia. The types are positioned on the graph according to the percentage of articles of that type in the dataset. Types below the line have a higher proportion in English Wikipedia than in Cebuano Wikipedia, and vice-versa. The brighter blue the label, the more often places of that type have been edited in English Wikipedia.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf we compare Cebuano and English Wikipedias, we see that human and bot editors have different priorities. Broadly speaking, Cebuano Wikipedia is bot-authored, while English Wikipedia is human-authored.2 In English Wikipedia, places of human occupation make up a bigger proportion of the total. Towns, localities, cities, urban parks and villages all make up a larger proportion of the place articles in English Wikipedia than in Cebuano Wikipedia. By contrast, in bot-authored Cebuano Wikipedia, geographical features such as mountains, lakes, bights and hills make up a much larger share of the Australian place articles. This difference is even more pronounced when we consider edit statistics on English Wikipedia. Consider articles about cities. Cities account for only 0.24% of the Australian places on English Wikipedia (0.10% in Cebuano), but they have received 5% of the human edits.3 Not only are human editors more likely to create articles about places with a strong human connection. They are also more likely to spend their time editing them.\nEnglish Wikipedia is strongly anthropocentric, at least compared to the geographical databases that form the basis of bot-authored Cebuano Wikipedia. English Wikipedia prioritises human over physical geography.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Most people who read about Australian places seem to come from Australia, or a handful of large English-speaking countries.\n\n\n\n\n\nUntil recently, it was difficult to know who reads Wikipedia. But in June 2023, the Wikimedia foundation released a new dataset of ‘pageview’ statistics, which breaks down Wikipedia’s readers by country.4 Unsurprisingly, Australian readers are most interested by far in Australian places. 30% of the pageviews in this dataset originate in Australia. Other significant sources of traffic include the USA (23%), UK (6%), India (8%) and Germany (5%).\nLike its human editors, Wikipedia’s readers prefer articles about places of human habitation or visitation. Among the top-ten-most-read-about places are six of Australia’s capital cities (Sydney, Melbourne, Canberra, Brisbane, Perth and Adelaide), and Australia’s three most famous tourist destinations (Uluru, the Sydney Opera House and the Great Barrier Reef). In this dataset, 29% of the recorded pageviews are for articles about cities.\nThese high-level statistics can obscure deeper patterns. Overall, for example, it would seem that Australian places are not hugely interesting to Indonesian readers, who contribute only 2.3% of the pageviews in the dataset. But this is partly because Indonesian Wikipedia is relatively small: only 1052 Australian places have an article in Indonesian Wikipedia. If we consider pageviews just for these 1052 places, however, the Indonesian share climbs to 2.6%. If we just look at the ten most-read articles in the dataset, the share of Indonesian pageviews climbs again to 3.4%. There are some places, like Christmas Island, just off the Indonesian coast, where the Indonesian share is as high as 7.6%.\nAustralia’s readership on Wikipedia is affected by many causes that are hard to disentangle. Wikipedia is hugely popular in the USA, UK and India. These countries also have strong linguistic, cultural and historical links to Australia. Wikipedia has a much smaller audience in Indonesia, but Indonesia is geographically Australia’s closest neighbour, and some Australian places—such as Christmas Island—are especially significant there. It is sometimes said that the internet has abolished distance, and created a “space of flows” or “global village” in which everyone is a next-door neighbour. This is clearly not the case when we look at Wikipedia reader data.\n\n\n\nTBC: Fran’s section"

    "title": "How Australian places are represented in Wikipedia",
    "section": "Extent of Coverage",
    "text": "Extent of Coverage\nIn this section, we consider how English Wikipedia covers the Australian landmass. Which places are described? Which parts of the continent are densely described, and which are not? How are Indigenous places represented?\n\nThe data\n35,077 Australian places have an article on English Wikipedia. We calculate this figure using Wikidata’s query engine. Using Wikidata, we find every physical location or geographic feature that has the property country:Australia. Using Wikidata, we retrieve coordinates for each place. Using English Wikipedia, we retrieve the text of each article and the number of edits.5\n\n\nWhat the data show\nEnglish Wikipedia constructs Australia from a human, and more specifically and white-settler perspective. Figure 5 show the distribution of place articles across the continent of Australia. There are many articles about the large capital cities of Perth, Adelaide, Melbourne, Sydney and Brisbane, whose central areas appear as bright yellow hexagons on the map. There may be more than 1000 articles describing places in each of these cities. The further you move from the cities, the fewer articles there are. Across Australia’s arid centre, there are very few articles indeed.\nIt may seem obvious that Wikipedians should focus their attention on cities and other places of human habitation. But this is not the only way. Figure 6 shows the distribution of Australian places in Cebuano Wikipedia. As shown in Figure 3, Cebuano has a much stronger focus on natural features than English Wikipedia does. Since natural features such as rivers, knolls and valleys are distributed evenly across the landscape, Australian places in Cebuano Wikipedia are distributed more evenly across the continent.\nThe human focus of English Wikipedia is accentuated in Figure 7, which visualises edit activity. Not only are there more articles about the Australia’s large cities on English Wikipedia, but editors devote considerably more attention to them. There are numerous small regions near the big cities where human editors have made more than 100,000 edits. To put this in perspective, the total number of human edits in the dataset is 1,499,782. A few regions with more than 100,000 edits each form a significant part of this total.\nIn sum, English Wikipedia is strongly anthropocentric. The places that matter are human places. More than this, they are white-settler places. English Wikipedia’s focus is on the cities, states and country of Australia, as established by predominately British settlers in the Eighteenth and Nineteenth Centuries. In the next section, we consider one way that English Wikipedians have tried to redress this imbalance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5: All Australian places in English Wikipedia that lie on or near the Australian mainland. Each hexagon represents an equally-sized zone of the earth’s surface, and is coloured to represent how many articles are written about places in that zone.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6: Like Figure 5, but for Cebuano Wikipedia. Since Cebuano Wikipedia focuses on geographic features rather than human habitation, its place articles are more evenly distributed across the continent.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7: This map counts the number of edits rather than the number of places in each hexagon. English Wikipedia’s editors focus their attention overwhelmingly on metropolitan centres and surrounding regions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIndigenous places\nWikipedia provides a “native name” system, which editors of Australian Wikipedia have used to achieve dual-naming of Australian places. There are two ways a Wikipedian can assign a “native name” to a Wikipedia article. They can insert Template:Native_name into the text of the article; or they can fill in the “native_name” field in articles “Infobox.” These two approaches to dual-naming can be seen on the articles for Naarm, Boorloo and Deerubbin.\nFigure 8 shows all the places in the dataset that have been dual-named on Wikipedia. 2,261 places in the dataset have been dual-named, or about 6% of the total. This is of course a small quantity, given that the entire Australian landmass had been occupied and named by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people for tens of thousands of years prior to European settlement. But Wikipedia’s efforts are comparable to those of state agencies like the Australian Broadcasting Corporation or the state-based Geographical Names Boards.\nThere are two obvious flaws to Wikipedia’s dual-naming system.\nOffensive terminology: The term “native” is offensive in Australia. Australian Wikipedians know this. The members of Wikiproject Australia have cautioned other editors not to use the term in the text of articles, although they have not attempted to remove the term from Wikipedia’s software. Of course, Template:Native_name is not only used in an Australian context. The article for the Italian city of Florence, for example, gives “Firenze” as the “native name.”\nEuropean priority: The dual-naming system prioritises the European construction of place. Invariably, the article on English Wikipedia gives the settler name as the primary name. Thus a visitor to Boorloo will be redirected to an article entitled “Perth.” More deeply, for a place to even exist in Wikipedia, it first needs to exist in the European system of spatial divisions. When Europeans occupied Australia, they divided the landmass up into colonies, parishes, cities and later into states and suburbs, largely ignoring the structures that already existed in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander societies. The best that dual-naming can do is to attach an Indigenous name to one of these places established by settlers.\nWhat of Indigenous places that predated European colonisation? In the next section, we consider how these have been left out of the Wikipedia definition of “place.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8: Like Figure 5, but showing only those places with an Indigenous name. They form only a small portion of the total.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLimitations: what is a place?\n\nThe land and sea not empty shed that man has built. There’s something in it.\n—Matthew Dhulumburrk with Mark Dreygus (Northern Land Council), quoted in Rose (1996, 8)\n\nTogether, Wikipedia and Wikidata construct space in particular way. Space is made up of physical locations and geographical features. Each feature or location is assigned a Wikidata ID, a Wikipedia article, and a set of coordinates. In this familiar model of space, the earth is a continuous surface, upon which individual places can be precisely located.\nWikipedia’s spatial system is typical, and interoperates with other digital systems. For example, a visitor to the Wikipedia page for Townsville can view data derived directly from the Australian Bureau of Statistics, such as the population or area of the city. If the visitor clicks on Townsville’s co-ordinates, they will be taken to the city’s geohack page, which connects the Wikipedia article to dozens of other compatible systems, such as Google Maps and NASA Worldwind. If the user clicks Tools → Wikidata Item, they will arrive at Townsville’s Wikidata page, which links them to other-language Wikipedia articles about Townsville, and also links to Townsville’s record in other databases, such as VIAF, GeoNames and the National Library of Latvia. Wikipedia is part of a vast network of systems that all cooperate to construct the space of the Earth in a certain way.\nThis way of constructing space is not the only way. In particular, it is inconsistent with many of the ways that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people construct space. We are not the right people, and this report is not the right document in which to give a full and careful account of the many ways Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander understand space. But we can indicate how Indigenous concepts of country fail to register as “places” in the system.\nCountry contrasts with the Wikipedia notion of “place” in at least two ways. First, country is not a “physical location” or “geographic feature”: it is “multi-dimensional—it consists of people, animals, plants, Dreamings; underground, earth, soils, minerals and waters, surface water, and air” (Rose 1996, 8). Second, country is a local rather than a universal concept: “The fact of localised knowledge is itself Law. This system does not invite people to assume that they can or should know everything” (Rose 1996, 13). Since it is holistic and local, country conflicts with Wikipedia’s physical/geographical and universal construction of space.\nAs a result, country is not represented as a place in Wikipedia, and does not figure in our dataset. The Wikipedia spatial equation, 1 place = 1 article, breaks down in Australia. The closest Wikipedia comes to representing country is in its articles about Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples and languages. For example, the articles about the Arrernte_people and Pitjantjatjara people indicate the extent and importance of their countries, but their countries are not represented as places in our dataset. In Wikipedia’s terms, these are articles not about places, but about peoples."

How Australians are Represented in Wikipedia uses a dataset of more than 80,000 Wikipedia biographies to reveal Wikipedia represents the people who make up Australia.\nIn 2024, we consider places. How Australian Places are Represented in Wikipedia will consider how the world’s only continent-sized country makes its way into the world’s only planet-sized encyclopaedia.\nIn 2025, we consider events. How Australian Events are Represented in Wikipedia will range over 60,000 years of human history in Australia, revealing which structures, conjunctures and events emerge from deep time to take their place in the encyclopaedia.\nThese reports primarily fulfil Objectives 2 and 3 of the wikihistories project:\n\nObjective 2: Map the scope of entries relating to Australian historic events on Wikipedia in order to analyse who and what is systematically omitted.\n\nObjective 3: Investigate how Wikipedia’s representations are constructed through practice.\n\nSupported by Australian Research Council Grant DP220100662.\nThe Wikihistories project would like to acknowledge the Gadigal people of the Eora Nation, and the Wurundjeri Woi-wurrung and Bunurong peoples, upon whose ancestral lands our University campuses stand.

    "section": "Analysis",
    "text": "Analysis\n\nAustralianness\nIn this report, we do not seek to define what it means to be ‘Australian’. Instead, we aim to identify the ‘markers of Australianness’ that define what it means to be ‘Australian’ in Wikipedia. In Wikipedia, the primary marker of Australianness is membership of Category:Australian people. In Wikidata, no marker can be said to be primary, but the most frequent in our dataset is P27(Q408), a property meaning that a person is a ‘citizen’ of Australia. In both cases, we will see that there is a sharp divide between the way Wikipedians have defined the marker, and they way they have used it in practice.\nThere are two reasons we refrain from defining ‘Australian’ for ourselves. In the first case, our opinion is not at all important—what matters is Wikipedia’s opinion. In the second case, it is exceptionally difficult to define ‘Australian’ in a non-arbitrary way. In two dimensions, space and time, the concept of ‘Australian’ poses startling difficulties.\nIn space, it is difficult to judge whether a person is close enough to Australia to count as Australian. At one end of the specturm is someone who is born, lives and dies in Australia, such as Oodgeroo Noonuccal. There can be no dispute that such a person is Australian. At the other end of the spectrum is someone who has only a passing cultural or economic connection to Australia, such as Steve Wozniak, one of the more surprising members of Category:Australian people. Then there is the problem of the diaspora. Are the children of Australians Australian, even if born overseas? If, like Rupert Murdoch, you leave Australia and renounce your citizenship, do you remain Australian? There may be easy answers to these questions in specific contexts, for example, when calculating a person’s tax liability or entitlement to vote, but in the context of an encyclopaedic project like Wikipedia, they cannot be easily resolved.\nIn time, it is difficult to judge when in history it becomes reasonable to describe someone as ‘Australian’. Humans first arrived in Australia some 60,000 years ago, but they did not call the continent ‘Australia’. The term ‘Terra Australis’ (‘Southern Land’) was coined by 16th-century Europeans. At this time, ‘Terra Australis’ was merely a proposal, as no European had visited either Australia or Antarctica. In the end, neither Australia nor Antarctica matched European expectations about the ‘Southern Land’, though Australia, being the first that Europeans visited, acquired the name. New South Wales was invaded by the British in 1788. The term ‘Australia’ was substituted for ‘Terra Australis’ in 1813. The colonies of Australia federated into a single Commonwealth in 1901. The resulting Commonwealth of Australia only achieved full independence from Britain in 1988. The problem of time is compounded by geology. In the course of Australia’s human occuption, the very landmass has altered considerably. Only 10,000 years ago, the Australian mainland, Papua New Guinea and Tasmania formed a single contiguous landmass that geologers call Sahul. Are all the people who occupied Sahul at any point in time ‘Australians’? Or can only residents or citizens of the country ‘Australia’ be so named? Like space, time wreaks havoc on the category ‘Australian’.\nThe editors of Wikipedia and Wikidata grapple with both these problems. The result is a kind of categorical anarchy, where different parts of the system work with different concepts of ‘Australianess’ and apply different criteria of connection. It is for this reason that we talk of ‘markers of Australianness’ in Wikipedia. How do these markers work?\n\nIn the category system\nThe primary marker of Australianness in Wikipedia, as we have seen, is membership of Category:Australian people. The category offers simple criteria for membership:\n\nThis category lists notable Australian-born people, or people who identify themselves as Australian.\n\nA user who clicks on the hyperlink ‘Australian’ will be taken to the Wikipedia page for Australia, which defines Australia as follows:\n\nAustralia, officially the Commonwealth of Australia, is a sovereign country comprising the mainland of the Australian continent, the island of Tasmania, and numerous smaller islands.\n\nThese definitions seem to offer a strong answer to the problems of space and time. ‘Australia’ is the ‘Commonwealth of Australia’, the sovereign state that has existed since 1901. In space, a person must be ‘born’ in Australia, or ‘identify themselves’ as a member of the country. In time, Australia is the Commonwealth of Australia, and so has only existed since 1901.\nThe problem is, this explicit definition does not at all describe the contents of Category:Australian people. In the spatial dimension, the category includes living people such as Steve Wozniak and Darrell Duffie who were neither born in Australia nor identify themselves with it. In the time dimension, the category includes many historical figures who long preceded the Commonwealth of Australia, such as Bennelong, Mary Reiby, Robert Lowe and Louisa Atkinson. Finally, it lists thousands of entities that aren’t people, such as First Ever, the sportswear manufacturer, and ‘Hand on Your Heart’, the 1989 single by Kylie Minogue. How has Category:Australian people expanded to include so many pages that contradict its own explicit definition?\nThe answer lies in the category’s size. When editors include articles in Category:Australian people, they do not necessarily do so intentionally. Category:Australian people is the root node of a vast category graph. The editor who categorised Steve Wozniak as a staff member of the University of Technology Sydney was probably unaware that they were thereby categorising Wozniak as an ‘Australian person’. The category for academic staff at UTS lies several layers deep in the category graph, 4 steps away from the root (Figure 2). Perhaps an editor may quibble that a person who works at UTS is not necessarily ‘from Sydney’, but in the present state of the category graph, there is no other way to mark a staff member of UTS. The category graph is strictly hierarchical. A subcategory cannot be removed from its parent category for the sake of a single page.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: The category for UTS staff lies four steps away from Category:Australian people\n\n\n\n\n\nCategory:Australian people has 9,492 subcategories, many of which are even farther from the root than the staff of UTS. We can get a sense of how vast this structure is by taking diameter of the category graph. In this case, the diameter is 11, which means that the most distant subcategory of Category:Australian people is 11 steps away. Such distant nodes are called ‘eccentric’ in graph theory. In this case, the most distant subcategory truly is eccentric: Category:Custard (band) compilation albums does not include articles about ‘Australian people’ at all, but about indie rock records. This case is extreme. The case of UTS staff members is more typical. If we consider all the articles that have been placed in Category:Australian people or its subcategories, we find that the subcategories used are on average 3.17 steps away from the root, with a standard deviation of 0.95. In the typical case, when an editor adds an article to an ‘Australian people’ subcategory, the subcategory is 2-4 steps away from the root. It seems likely that editors are mostly unaware of the category graph as a whole. Editors work locally, trying to find the best categorisations for their articles, while Wikipedia’s systems work globally, enforcing the hierarchical logic of the enormous and usually invisible category graph.\nThere is thus a contradiction between the global and local logics of the category graph. Frequently, the category graph also contradicts the actual content of the encyclopaedia. First Ever is categorised as an ‘Australian person’ even though the text of the article identifies it as ‘an Australian manufacturing company’.1 These contradictions breed a pervasive categorical anarchy. Seen from afar, Wikipedia is extremely lax about who or what counts as ‘Australian’. A person—or even not a person—can be categorised as ‘Australian’ for whatever reason seems reasonable in the local context. Such laxity is probably necessary to Wikipedia’s encyclopaedic ambitions—how else could the vague concept of ‘Australian person’ ever find a place in Wikipedia? Wikidata is a different beast. Rather than a collection of textual articles that can speak for themselves, it is a database of structured facts (called ‘claims’) which are supposed to provide a reliable machine-readable knowledge graph. Can categorical anarchy prevail in such a system?\n\n\nIn Wikidata\nWikidata’s contributors are well aware of the difficulties of space and time. The simplest way to mark someone as ‘Australian’ in Wikidata is to give ‘Australia’ as the person’s ‘country of citizenship’ (P27). Our dataset contains 47,445 ‘Australian citizens’ according to P27. A glance at the Talk page for P27 reveals that Wikidata’s editors are well aware of the problems with trying to categorised people as ‘Australian’ in any stable way.\nThe user Ghouston clearly articulates the problem of time in a post from 2018:\n\nIt’s not easy. Australian citizenship didn’t exist before 1949, yet Australia as a federation has existed since 1901 and the term “Australian” was in use in the 19th century. To say that the United Kingdom was created in 1927 or the Netherlands perhaps in 1815 or 1945 or China in 1949 is to ignore much of the history of these countries as states.\n\nTwo years later, Ghouston provides additional sources and mentions a possible solution:\n\nSeparate items for citizenships and nationalities have been proposed previously. Perhaps it would help. The term “Australian” for people living in Australia was already used in the 19th century, before Australia had even been federated as a state, e.g., [2]. According to [3], Australia started issuing passports after federation, and didn’t even restrict it to British subjects until 1938, but it seems that passports were not used much prior to WW1, and there was a more flexible attitude to nationality.\n\nAt the time of writing, there is no Wikidata property for ‘nationality’. Instead, the property of citizenship is limited according to the ‘inception’ (P571) of the given country and the death date of the given person. The start date of Australia is given as 1 January 1901 in Wikidata. If a person is assigned Australian citizenship in Wikidata, and their death date occurs before 1 January 1901, then a warning appears in their Wikidata page. At the time of writing, the Wikidata item for colonial poet Charles Harpur contains such a warning (Figure 3). Harpur, who proudly described himself as as ‘An Australian’ in newspaper publications from the 1830s, died in 1868.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Citzenship warning banner for Charles Harpur\n\n\n\nThis solution combines flexibility with clarity.\n\nFlexibility: It is possible to mark the ‘Australianness’ of Charles Harpur and others who have been identified as Australian throughout history.\nClarity: Wikidata provides clear guidance to its contributors through the warning banner. As far as Wikidata is concerned, Australian citizenship was available to people from 1901.\n\nThe price of this clarity and flexibility is inconsistency and quixotism.\n\nInconsistency: Wikidata flatly contradicts itself as far as historical figures like Charles Harpur are concerned. Was Harpur a citizen of Australia or not? Wikidata also contradicts, or at least brings into question, its own definition of ‘citizenship’. Wikidata defines citizenship (P27) thus: ‘the object is a country that recognizes the subject as its citizen’ This definition is not reflected in P27’s rules: all that is required is that the country exists prior to the supposed citizen’s birth date. If Harpur were posthumously recognised as a citizen by the Commonwealth of Australia, this could not currently be reflected in the database. The warning banner would remain.\nQuixotism: As Ghouston himself observes, Australia did not have an official system for conferring citizenship until 1949. By seeming to choose 1 January 1901 as earliest permitted date, Wikidata has invented its own concept of Australian citizenship. Is this quixotism consistent with Wikidata’s self-description as a ‘secondary database, collecting structured data’? Does Wikidata collect structured data, or does it structure collected data?\n\nWikimedians are aware of the difficulty of time. The state of P27 suggests that they are content for the minute to leave the difficulty unresolved.\nThe difficulty of space is less clearly articulated on the talk page for P27 (‘country of citizenship’). Perhaps this is because the concept ‘citizenship’ presupposes a deep and publicly sanctioned connection between the person and the country. In a sense, Wikidata delegates the question of a person’s spatial connection to Australia, by recording when a person appears in a known database of Australians. These databases make their own decisions about the ‘Australianness’ of their subjects. The Dictionary of Australian Biography, for example, does not required its subjects to be Australian at all, as explained in their FAQs:\n\nDo you have to be an Australian to be in the ADB?\nThe ADB includes anyone who has made a significant contribution to the Australian nation.\n\nThe AusStage database, meanwhile, records any person who ‘contributed’ in some way to a theatrical performance in Australia, or to an overseas performance of an Australian theatrical work. AusStage and the Australian Dictionary of Biography provide very broad markers of Australianness. By contrast, the Re-Member database of the Parliament of Victoria provides a stricter marker of a person’s Australianness. To appear in Re-Member, a person must be a former member of the Parliament of Victoria. We identified dozens of other databases that indicated ‘Australianess’ in Wikidata. When a Wikimedian links a person to the Australian Dictionary of Biography (P1907), AusStage (P8292), Re-Member (P8633), or some other database of Australians, the linked database will encode a different answer to the question ‘Who Counts as Australian?’\n\n\n\nGender\nAlthough it is impossible to provide a unitary definition for ‘Australian’ in Wikidata and Wikipedia, we have shown that it is possible to derive a large list of people who are marked as ‘Australian’ in some way across the encyclopaedia and database. What is the composition of this list? We begin with gender.\nTo determine the gender of a person in our dataset, we rely on the Wikidata property P21:Sex or gender. In our dataset, nearly all records have a sex or gender recorded (Figure 4). Only 6 records lack a P21 statement about their sex or gender.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSex or Gender Label\nTotal\n\n\n\n\nfa’afafine\n1\n\n\nfemale\n16560\n\n\ngenderfluid\n6\n\n\ngenderqueer\n1\n\n\nintersex\n3\n\n\nintersex woman\n1\n\n\nmale\n66375\n\n\nnon-binary\n28\n\n\ntrans man\n3\n\n\ntrans woman\n27\n\n\ntransgender\n2\n\n\nNA\n6\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Gender breakdown of the Australian biographies dataset\n\n\n\n\nWeathington and Brubaker (2023) have strongly critiqued Wikidata’s representation of sex and gender, observing that “Queer identities are recorded in a database in clunky, inaccurate, or self-contradictory ways” (p. 2) and that the database ignores the individual’s right to determine their own sexual presentation. Nonetheless, we are compelled to rely on Wikidata’s representation of individuals’ sex and/or gender if we wish to assess its representation of human diversity in Australia. To this end, we categorise our dataset into three broad groups: male, female and trans, non-binary or intersex. While we may assume that most of those marked as ‘male’ or ‘female’ are cis-male or -female, we cannot determine this from the available data, and so opt for the less specific ‘male’ and ‘female’.\nFemale biographies are clearly under-represented among Wikipedia’s Australian articles. (Figure 4) shows all the articles in the dataset, categorised by their gender on Wikidata. The gap between male and female biographies appears to have remained constant over time (Figure 5). Viewing the data on a logarithmic scale emphasises the parallel track of male and female biographies in Australian Wikipedia, while also allowing us to visualise the similar growth of trans, non-binary or intersex biographies (Figure 6).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5: Growth of the Australian biographies dataset over time, broken down by gender\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6: Growth of the Australian biographies dataset over time, broken down by gender, on a log scale to compare growth rates for each gender.\n\n\n\n\n\nNot only are male, female and LGBTQI+ Australians represented in different numbers in the encyclopaedia, they are represented by different words. To show this, we downloaded the introductions of each article in the encyclopaedia, and used the tf-idf statistic to determine which words were most distinctive for each group of biographies. Which words tend to appear more often in the introductions of articles about male, female and trans, non-binary or intersex Australians?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7: Comparing the introductions of each article in the Australian biographies dataset, using the tf-idf metric to reveal the most distinctive words in the introductions for each gender grouping.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7 discloses two significant patterns:\n\nExplicit marking of non-Male genders: First, Wikipedia articles are more likely to explicitly mention the sex or gender of a female or trans, non-binary or intersex Australian. The high tf-idf score for “women’s” in biographies of Females probably reflects the fact that female sporting teams often have “women’s” in their names. Thus Sam Kerr is said to represent Australian in the “national women’s team”, while Harry Kewell was simply a member of “the Australian national team”. The situation for trans, non-binary or intersex Australians is even more marked. ‘Transgender’, ‘sex’ and ‘woman’ all appear as distinctive terms in the introductions of Wikipedia biographies in this group.\nDominance of sport and entertainment: Across all three gender categories, sport and entertainment are dominant themes. The male biographies seem less likely to describe entertainers than those in the other categories. Unsuprisingly, the trans, non-binary or intersex biographies seem more likely to discuss social affairs, ‘activist’ and ‘rights’ being prominent terms in the introductions of these biographies.\n\nThe data support the views of Weathington and Brubaker (2023). In Australian Wikipedia, maleness is the unmarked default. Female and especially trans, non-binary or intersex Australians are described using terms such as ‘women’ or ‘transgender’; there is no need to explicitly mention that a person is male or cisgender. In the case of trans, non-binary or intersex people, this explicit marking of gender goes a step further. Australians in this group are likely to be described as ‘activists’, presumbly on gender issues. Biographies of trans, non-binary or intersex Australians problematise gender in a manner that biographies of male Australians do not.\nWikipedia’s defaulting to maleness probably reflects the linguistic habits of broader Australian society, but it could also be exacerbated by the encylopaedia’s obsession with sport and entertainment. Both sport and entertainment are highly gendered fields. Men and women compete in gendered competitions such as the soccer or cricket World Cups and receive gendered commendations such as Best Actress at the Academy Awards. While male Australians may dominate non-male Australians in fields such as politics, business and the arts, these fields are not so explicitly gendered. Sam Kerr may indeed be captain of the “women’s national team,” but it makes no sense to describe Vanessa Hudson as the CEO of a “women’s corporation.” Sport and entertainment are fields that reflect society’s deepest-held and most immoveable convictions. Wikipedia’s powerful focus on these fields may place the encyclopaedia behind other parts of Australia in the evolution of non-gendered language.\nFigure 8 suggests a silver lining to this story of the gender gap. Although male Australians continue to greatly outnumber female and trans, non-binary or intersex on Wikipedia, many of the male biographies are of low quality. In fact, if we consider only C-Class articles and above, the proportion of female biographies rises from 19.9% to 33.0%. It appears that editors have devoted considerably more effort to creating pages about men than about women or people of other genders, but that editors devote more effort on average to maintaining pages about non-male Australians.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8: Page assessment class by gender in the Australian biographies dataset\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIndigeneity\nThe distinction between ‘settler’ and ‘indigenous’ Australian pervades Wikipedia in a cryptic way. Race and ethncity are portrayed in a lopsided manner in Wikipedia, much like gender. In English Wikipedia, Mandiberg (2023) observes, people are not officially classified by ‘race’, but whiteness is assumed as a default, and a person is far more likely to be categorised by their ethnic or national origin if they are non-white.\nThere is no explicit category for ‘settler’ or ‘white’ Australian. There are categories for Category:Immigrants to Australia and Category:Australian people of European Descent, but these are applied only haphazardly to indicate the ‘settler’ status of a minority of Australians. A good example is Tony Abbott. According to his Wikipedia biography, he was born in London to English parents, and ‘migrated to Australia at the age of two’. His page is nearly 20 years old, and has been edited more than 4000 times.. Nonetheless, no-one has thought to categorise him either as an ‘immigrant’ or as an Australian ‘of European descent’. Extending Mandiberg’s arguments, we can hypothesise that ‘settler’ status is assumed in Australian Wikipedia, and a person’s whiteness or migrant status is considered unremarkable if they are British. We substantiate this hypothesis below.\nThere may be no single category for ‘settler’ or ‘white’ Australian, but there is certainly a single overarching category for Indigenous Australian people. Within this category, editors are instructed to sub-categorise Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians as precisely as possible (Figure 9). These subcategories fall into three main kinds:\n\nSub-categories for mob or language group, e.g. Category:Pitjantjatjara people.\nSub-categories for occupation, e.g. Category:Indigenous Australian linguists (Curiously, neither guide nor tracker is considered an occupation in this scheme.)\nMiscellaneous subcategories, including Category:Members of the Stolen Generations, Category:Last known speakers of an Aboriginal language, Category:Indigenous Australian feminists and Category:Australian Aboriginal elders.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 9: Template:Category diffuse instructs editors to categorise Indigenous Australian People more precisely\n\n\n\nCategory:Indigenous Australian people is actually nested quite deeply within the Australian category graph (Figure 10). Figure 10 may at first be confusing to Australian readers, because it is common in Australia to refer to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people as “First Nations Australians.” In English Wikipedia’s category graph, however, the term “First Nations” is used the Canadian sense.2 In this instance, Wikipedia’s category graph is potentially incendiary, because it appears to imply there is no special connection between Indigenous Australians and the continent to which they are indigenous. The overarching Category:Australian people by ethnic or national origin is organised predominantly by continent or region. There are sub-categories for Australians of African, Asian, Carribean, Latin American, Middle Eastern, North American and Oceanian descent. There is no category for “Australians of Australian descent”, nor is Category:Australian people of Indigenous Australian descent included as a subcategory of Category:Australian people of Oceanian descent.3 By contrast, Category:Australians of First Nations descent is included as a subcategory of Category:Australian people of Canadian descent, which is itself a subcategory of Category:Australians of North American descent. In this local portion of the graph, the link between First Nations Canadians and Canada is formally encoded. The link between Indigenous Australian people and Australia is not. A naïve reader of the graph (such as a computer program) might erroneously conclude that First Nations Australians have the same relationship to Australia as Indigenous Australians.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 10: Local portion of the category graph for Category:Australian people, showing how Category:Indigenous Australian people fits into the system\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Wikipedia’s defence, the indigeneity of Indigenous Australians is encoded in other ways. In this local portion of the graph, a human can see from the labels of Category:Australian people of Indigenous Australian descent and Category:Indigenous Australian people that people in these categories are indigenous to Australia. Looking beyond this local portion of the graph, we can also see that Category:Indigenous peoples of Australia is a subcategory of Category:Indigenous peoples of Oceania. It is nonetheless curious that the local portion of the graph that classifies Australians by ‘ethnic or national origin’ should de-emphasise Category:Indigenous Australian people.\nThe situation is different for other countries in English Wikipedia. Other settler-colonial countries include categories for their own indigenous peoples directly beneath the super-category for people by ethnic or national origin. For example, Category:Indigenous Mexicans is a direct subcategory of Category:Mexican people by ethnic or national origin, while the analogous Australian category, Category:Indigenous Australian people, is two steps deeper in the graph. A similar pattern holds for other settler-colonial states. New Zealand, New Caledonia, South Africa and the United States all include top-level categories for their Indigenous peoples under the people by ethnic or national origin super-category.\nThere is a second notable difference between the category graphs for Australia and Mexico. We have seen that Australia’s Category:Australian people of indigenous peoples descent is used to classify people who are indigenous anywhere. The analogous Mexican category, Category:Mexican people of indigenous peoples descent, is used exclusively to classify indigenous peoples of Mexico itself. Brazil and Argentina similarly reserve their ‘indigenous peoples’ category for their own indigenous peoples.\nAustralia is not entirely alone. The subgraph for Category:Japanese people by ethnic or national origin also obfuscates the indigeneity of Japan’s indigenous peoples. There is no explicit category for Japanese people ‘of indigenous descent’. Instead, Category:Japanese Ainu people is included as a subcategory of Category:Japanese people of East Asian descent. In this way, the link between Ainu people and the region is locally marked in the category graph, but one must look elsewhere in the graph to discover that Ainu people are indigenous to Japan.\nIt is clear that quantifying indigenous representation in Wikipedia is a fraught exercise. Scholars are well advised to carefully consider how indigeneity is understood in different parts of the world, and then to pay close attention to the particular structure of ethnic and national classification in any particular part of Wikipedia.\nNonetheless, we can use the category graph to estimate the number of biographies of Indigenous Australians in Wikipedia. Figure 11 suggests that in recent years, Wikipedians may have begun to address the representation gap between Indigenous and settler Australians. Figure 11 shows the proportion of biographies in our dataset that fall within Category:Indigenous Australian people. The representation gap for Indigenous Australians is not so stark as the representation gap for non-male Australians. According to the Australian Census, the number of Indigenous Australians grew from 2.5% of Australia’s population to 3.2% between 2011 and 2021. In our estimate, the proportion of Indigenous biographies in Category:Australian people, went from 2.29% on January 1 2011 to 2.05% on January 1 2021. At the time of our data collection, the proportion had risen again to 2.16%. Although comparison with the census would suggest that Wikipedia under-represents Indigenous Australians, the representation gap is currently narrowing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 11: Proportion of Indigenous biographies in the Australian biographies dataset over time.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs for gender see 8, we can consider how indicators of page quality alter the picture. Figure 12 does indeed suggest that the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander biographies repeat the same pattern as for gender. Although biographies of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians are less numerous than biographies of other Australians, they are generally of higher quality according to Wikipedia’s own quality assessment standards. If we consider only articles of C-Class and above, then the proportion of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander biographies in the dataset climbs from 2.2% to 3.7%.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 12: Page assessment class broken down by membership of Category:Indigenous Australian people\n\n\n\n\n\nThese results do need to be taken with a grain of salt. As Thorpe, Sentance, and Booker (2023) show, Wikipedia’s articles on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people are dominated by ‘settler narratives’, and typically rely on public-domain sources that reflect the values of Nineteenth-Century British colonists. Our analysis of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander representation in Wikipedia must therefore be supplemented with more detailed analysis of the sources and rhetoric of the articles themselves.\n\n\nHistorical period\nThe final aspect of human diversity we consider is historical period. How are people from different periods in Australia’s history represented in the encyclopaedia? To estimate this, we rely on date of birth data from Wikidata. Wikidata records a date of birth for 70,741 of the articles in our dataset. This data is displayed in Figure 13, which shows the number of biographies in the dataset according to the decade in which the person was born.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 13: Articles in the Australian biographies dataset broken down by the decade in which the subject of the biography was born.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 13 displays the obvious colonial bias in the dataset. There are very few biographies of any persons prior to British colonisation of Australia. This is partly a product of our focus on biography. There is very little biographical data available about individual persons living in Australia prior to 1788. But this colonial bias also represents a darker side of Australian history. In the first half of the Nineteenth Century, the majority of Australia’s population was probably indigenous. Butlin (1994) estimates that that colonial population only overtook the indigenous population in the 1840s. According to his estimates, the population of Australia hovered around 600,000 from around 1800 until the 1840s, because the number of new migrants into the colony was roughly equal to the decline of the indigenous population due to British depradations (1994, 212). In Figure 13, this history is obscured. A naive interpreter of the figure might assume that Australia’s population grew continuously from the British invasion of 1788 until the present. In fact, there was a sharp decline in Australia’s population in the first two decades of settlement, followed by a period of relative stagnation.\nWe can conclude that Wikipedia’s Australian biographies broadly reflect the growth of colonial society in Australia since 1788. How closely does Wikipedia reflect this growth? Figure 14 compares our dataset to historical population growth figures from the Australian Bureau of Statistics (2016). This data records the growth of colonial society, because Indigenous Australians were excluded from the census until 1961. From this data, we calculate the colonial population growth for each decade from the 1780s to the 2010s. For example, in the 1810s, Australia’s population grew by 21,977 people. We then find the number of Wikipedia biographies for people whose date of birth lies in this decade, as in Figure 13, and calculate this as a percentage of the Australian population growth in that decade. For example, there are 662 biographies for people born in the 1810s in our dataset, which is equal to 3% of the colonial population growth for that decade. The two datasets are not perfectly comparable, because our data does not account for when a person migrated to Australia, but Figure 14 nonetheless clearly shows the historical bias of Wikipedia’s Australian biographies. There are many more articles per person in the early years of the colony compared to later on in Australia’s colonial history. Since the 1850s, the historical coverage of Australian Wikipedia biographies has been more equal.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 14: Number of articles in Australian biographies dataset compared to historical population growth statistics from the Australian Bureau of Statistics (2016).\n\n\n\n\n\nThis analysis by Historical Period complements our earlier analysis of Gender and Indigeneity in the dataset. Generally speaking, Wikipedia’s Australian biographies reflect the male-dominated settler narrative of Australia’s colonisation, though there are important caveats to this general finding."

    "section": "Conclusion",
    "text": "Conclusion\nIn the report above we’ve articulated how Wikipedia represents Australians according to multiple mechanisms for categorizing and defining Australianness in Wikipedia and Wikidata’s datasets and we’ve argued that Wikipedia’s datafied representations highlight the problems of taking any overly simplistic view of Wikipedia’s biases. The majority of quantitative studies of Wikipedia’s biases examine its trajectories in terms of global trends – for example, in the representation of women and men, Westerners and non-Westerners. And yet, what we’ve shown in this report is that in taking a national perspective we recognize the contingencies and contexts that significantly enhance such analyses.\nWe hope, then, that this study reveals the importance of examining Wikipedia at a local (national) level. Only by thinking about and with the container of the nation, can the specificities, paradoxes, and discontinuities of Wikipedia’s representation become evident. At a national level, we can start to understand how Wikipedia has represented women over time and how such representations compare to global trends. At a national level, we can ask new questions about people in ethnic categories that are particularly discriminated against and question whether the categorization norms are appropriate given alternative models that other nations have followed in relation to similar categories. At a national level, we can examine historical biases in the context of our knowledge about stories that the nation tells itself about who it is and where it comes from.\nIn this the methods of the discipline of history are helpful. Contingency, embeddedness, and human agency are central to the methods of history. Characteristics like identity or notability are not eternal, static, or natural. Although institutions such as nation states are hugely powerful and condition the experiences and behaviour of people, humans crucially have the power to act on and in the world. But they do so embedded in contexts that are always specific, both temporally and geographically. Moreover, historians, approach people in the midst of things: living in changing times and acting as best they can with the tools they have available to them (Pietsch and Flanagan 2020).\nWe show that it is possible to estimate how well Wikipedia represents the diversity of a given nation using page-level metadata. Counting pages is a good starting point, and can reveal representation gaps that Wikimedians can then attempt to redress. But counting pages is a difficult exercise, and must be performed sensitively. Rather than simply counting people with the most popular or prominent categories, we argue that is critical to also examine the semantics of the category structure itself. How might the dataset shift and morph depending on different semantic terms? How does the way in which categories are structured suggest a particular perspective about national identity? How is what the nation values reflected in the characteristics of those who tend to have a Wikipedia page?"

    "section": "Appendix: Data",
    "text": "Appendix: Data\nThe code to generate this report is contained in two files in the wikihistories reports Github repository:\n\nwho-counts-lib.R contains all the functions to import the data\nwho-counts-data.R combines the functions to import the full dataset. This script can be run with USE_CACHE &lt;- TRUE to import the data from the saved files for this report, or USE_CACHE &lt;- FALSE to regenerate the data afresh from Wikipedia and Wikidata\n\nAll the source code for the analysis is included in this report, and can be viewed on Github at who-counts.qmd.\n\nWikipedia’s category system\nFrom its inception, Wikipedia has provided a category system to ‘group together pages on similar subjects’, and provide useful ‘navigational links to pages in Wikipedia’. Wikipedia’s categories form a vast and complex tree. A category may contain infintely many subcategories, and those subcategories may themselves belong to infinitely many supercategories. Nearly all Wikipedia articles are categorised, partly due to the work of a task group and patrol whose job is to hunt down any uncategorised articles.\nIn this context, the first place we looked for biographies of Australian people on Wikipedia was Category:Australian people, which ‘lists notable Australian-born people, or people who identify themselves as Australian’. This category contains 99,626 articles, but not all are biographies. In the first case, there are many articles about groups of Australian people, e.g. Aboriginal Victorians or Australian Chamber Orchestra. In the second case, Category:Australian people is a vast category, with 9,492 subcategories. In the trackless expanse of these subcategories, some unexpected articles make their way into Category:Australian people, such as the classic glam rock album Living in the ’70s. We explain the ‘eccentricity’ of the category graph when we analyse Wikipedia’s definition of Australianness below. For now, we simply describe our method for filtering all the non-biographies out of Category:Australian people.\nTo filter out the non-biographies, we rely on Wikidata. We fetch the Wikidata item for each article in Category:Australian people, and check to see if it has property P31(Q5), ‘instance of:human’. While the possession of P31(Q5) is not a perfect signal that an article is a biography, we find that this criterion filters out nearly all the non-biographies. Applying this criterion, we identify 81,493 biographical articles in Category:Australian people.\n\n\nWikidata’s query service\nWikidata provides an alternative method for finding Australian biographies: its query service. Using the query service, it is possible to search for Wikidata items that possess given properties. If these Wikidata items have a corresponding Wikipedia page, the link can be automatically retrieved.\nIt is more complex to find the ‘Australians’ in Wikidata than in Wikipedia. Wikipedia provides a single master-category for ‘Australian people’. Wikidata does not. Instead, Wikidata can mark a person as ‘Australian’ in two main ways:\n\nIt can explicitly link a person to Australia (Q408) through properties such as citizenship (P27), place of birth (P19) or place of death (P570); or\nIt can implicitly link a person to Australia by identifying them in a database of Australians, such as the Dictionary of Australian Biography (P1907), Indigenous Australia (P9246), or Convict Records of Australia (P9919)\n\nWe queried Wikidata by 45 such properties suggesting Australianness. Using these properties, we were able to identify 85,773 Wikidata items representing Australian people. Of these Wikidata items, 63,692 items had a corresponding Wikipedia article.\nThe two datasets overlap substantially, but not completely (Figure 15). There are thousands of biographical articles in Category:Australian people whose Wikidata items do not clearly identify them as ‘Australian’. Likewise, there are hundreds of Wikidata items whose corresponding Wikipedia articles do not appear in Category:Australian people, even though the Wikidata item has P31(Q5), ‘instance of:human’, and also contains one or more ‘markers of Australianness’.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDataset\nNumber of Articles\n\n\n\n\nPerson only found by querying Wikidata\n1520\n\n\nPerson only found in Category:Australian people\n19321\n\n\nPerson found in both datasets\n62172\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 15: There is substantial, but incomplete overlap between the biographies in the two datasets\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMetadata\nWe combine our two datasets into a single larger dataset of 83,013 articles. To enable analysis of these articles, we then enrich them with three kinds of metadata:\n\nUsing the Wikidata Action API, we find each person’s dates, birthplace and gender.\nUsing the Wikipedia Action API, we download the introduction of each article for text analysis.\nUsing the XTools API, we download page usage data for each page, including the page creation date, assessment class (e.g. Good, Featured), pageviews and number of edits."
