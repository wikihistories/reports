    "text": "Who counts as Australian in Wikipedia and its sister-projects? How does Wikipedia portray Australia’s population? These questions are easy to ask but hard to answer, because of Wikipedia’s representational multiplicity. Wikipedia represents Australia in many ways. Its sister projects—Wikidata and Wikimedia Commons preminent among them—represent Australia in myriad other ways.\nIn this report, we consider several ways that Australians are represented in Wikipedia and Wikidata. We focus on four main modes of representation:\nIn Conclusion: beyond bias, we make some suggestions about how Wikipedians might like to improve the representation of Australians in the encyclopaedia. As well as addressing the traditional problem of ‘systemic bias’, we suggest that Wikipedians draw attention to the representational multiplicity of Wikipedia, so that visitors to the site can become more aware of the multiple definitions of ‘Australianness’ across the Wikiverse."

    "text": "The category system\nThe second answer Wikipedia gives to the question, ‘Who counts as Australian?’ is: everyone who falls under Category:Australian people. There are nearly 100,000 articles on English Wikipedia that relate to Australian people, and the number is growing consistently (Figure 1).2\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Category:Australian people has grown consistently since the early days of Wikipedia\n\n\n\n\nWhen editors include articles in Category:Australian people, they do not necessarily do so intentionally. Category:Australian people is the root node of a vast tree-like graph of categories. The editor who categorised Steve Wozniak as a staff member of the University of Technology Sydney was probably unaware that they were thereby categorising Wozniak as an ‘Australian person’. The category for academic staff at UTS lies several layers deep in the category graph, 4 steps away from the root: Category:Academic staff of the University of Technology Sydney → Category:People from Sydney by occupation → Category:Australian people by city and occupation → Category:Australian people by occupation → Category:Australian_people. Perhaps an editor may quibble that a person who works at UTS is not necessarily ‘from Sydney’, but in the present state of the category graph, there is no other way to mark a staff member of UTS. The category graph is strictly hierarchical. A subcategory cannot be removed from its parent category for the sake of a single page.\nCategory:Australian people has 9,220 subcategories, many of which are even farther from the root than the staff of UTS. We can get a sense of how vast this structure is by taking diameter of the category graph. In this case, the diameter is 11, which means that the most distant subcategory of Category:Australian people is 11 steps away. Such distant nodes are called ‘eccentric’ in graph theory. In this case, the most distant subcategory truly is eccentric: Category:Custard (band) compilation albums does not include articles about ‘Australian people’ at all, but about indie rock records. This case is extreme. The case of UTS staffmembers is more typical. If we consider all the articles that have been placed in Category:Australian people or its subcategories, we find that the subcategories used are on average 3.12 steps away from the root, with a standard deviation of 0.98. In the typical case, when an editor adds an article to an ‘Australian people’ subcategory, the subcategory is 2-4 steps away from the root. It seems likely that editors are mostly unaware of the category graph as a whole. Editors work locally, trying to find the best categorisations for their articles, while Wikipedia’s systems work globally, enforcing the hierarchical logic of the enormous and usually invisible category graph.\nIf Category:Australian people can include articles about indie rock albums, then the question arises: How many of the articles are actually biographies of people connected to Australia? If we can isolate these articles, then more detailed questions become possible: How are different kinds of people represented among Wikipedia’s ‘Australian’ biographies? Wikipedia itself does not clearly distinguish biographies from other kinds of article. To answer this question, we turn to its sister-project, Wikidata."

    "text": "Wikidata properties\nTo build a picture of the Australian people in Wikipedia, we queried Wikidata using its SPARQL endpoint. Wikidata clearly distinguishes humans from other kinds of entity. Wikidata is made up of items and properties. To describe the properties of an item, users insert statements into the database. Item Q5 represents the concept ‘human’. To mark another item as a human, it must be given the property P31, ‘instance of’ with the value ‘Q5’. So, for example, we can see that Q1064745, the poet Charles Harpur, is a human because he has the property P31(Q5), ‘instance of: human’. While there are of course many gaps in Wikidata, and in theory there could be human ‘items’ that lack P31(Q5), it seems that Wikidata’s contributors do a good job maintaining this part of the database. There are more than 10 million explicitly-marked humans in Wikidata, and it seems unlikely that many notable Australians have had their humanity overlooked by the system.\nAs a first step, we queried Wikidata to find all humans that were marked as ‘Australian’ in some way. Humans can be marked as Australian in two main ways on Wikidata:\n\nThey can be explicitly linked to Australia through properties such as citizenship [], place of birth [] or place of death [], or\nThey can be implicitly linked to Australia by being linked to a known database of Australians, such as the Dictionary of Australian Biography (P1907), Indigenous Australia(P9246), or Convict Records of Australia (P9919)\n\nWe queried Wikidata by 51 properties that denote Australianness. Together, these properties are linked to 63260 unique humans in the database.\nThe Wikidata dataset and the Wikipedia dataset do not perfectly overlap, as shown in (Figure 2). A small number of the Wikidata Australians have Wikipedia articles that fall outside Category:Australian People, while there are more than 30,000 articles in Category:Australian People which do not correspond to an Australian person has recorded in Wikidata.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Wikidata set?\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Wikipedia Set?\n\n\nFALSE\n\n\nTRUE\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTRUE\n\n\n37401\n\n\n60817\n\n\n\n\nFALSE\n\n\nNA\n\n\n2546\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Many of the Wikidata items correspond to a Wikipedia page in Category:Australian People, but many do not\n\n\n\n\nsize in bytes\npageviews\narticle ratings\nnumber of edits\n\nTODO: Dig into category graph to explore gender and indigeneity."
