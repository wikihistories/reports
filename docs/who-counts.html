<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Digging Wikipedia: The Online Encyclopedia as a Digital Cultural Heritage Gateway and Site;,citation_abstract=The online encyclopedia Wikipedia is both a cultural reference to store, refer to, and organize digitized and digital information, as well as a key contemporary digital heritage endeavor in itself. Capitalizing on this dual nature of the project, this article introduces Wikipedia as a digital gateway to and site of an active engagement with cultural heritage. We have developed the open source and freely available analysis architecture Contropedia to examine already existing volunteer user-generated participation around cultural heritage and to promote further engagement with it. Conceptually, we employ the notion of memory work, as it helps to treat Wikipedia’s articles, edit histories, and discussion pages as a rich resource to study how cultural heritage is received and (re)worked in and across languages and cultures. Contropedia’s architecture allows for the study of the negotiations around and appreciation of cultural heritage without assuming an unchallenged and universal understanding of cultural heritage. The analysis facilitated by Contropedia thus sheds light on the contentious articulation of perspectives on tangible and intangible heritage grounded by conflicting conceptions of events, ideas, places, or persons. Technologically, Contropedia combines techniques based on mining article edit histories and analyzing discussion patterns in talk pages to identify and visualize heritage-related disputes within an article, and to compare these across language versions. In terms of digital heritage, Contropedia presents a powerful tool that opens up a core resource to cultural heritage studies. Moreover, it can form part of a conceptually grounded, technically advanced, and practically enrolled infrastructure for public education that opens up the dynamic formation of both knowledge about cultural heritage and new forms of digital cultural heritage that show a considerable amount of friction.;,citation_author=Christian Pentzold;,citation_author=Esther Weltevrede;,citation_author=Michele Mauri;,citation_author=David Laniado;,citation_author=Andreas Kaltenbrunner;,citation_author=Erik Borra;,citation_publication_date=2017-04;,citation_cover_date=2017-04;,citation_year=2017;,citation_fulltext_html_url=https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3012285;,citation_issue=1;,citation_doi=10.1145/3012285;,citation_issn=1556-4673, 1556-4711;,citation_volume=10;,citation_journal_title=Journal on Computing and Cultural Heritage;">
<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Event Detection in Wikipedia Edit History Improved by Documents Web Based Automatic Assessment;,citation_abstract=A majority of current work in events extraction assumes the static nature of relationships in constant expertise knowledge bases. However, in collaborative environments, such as Wikipedia, information and systems are extraordinarily dynamic over time. In this work, we introduce a new approach for extracting complex structures of events from Wikipedia. We advocate a new model to represent events by engaging more than one entities that are generalizable to an arbitrary language. The evolution of an event is captured successfully primarily based on analyzing the user edits records in Wikipedia. Our work presents a basis for a singular class of evolution-aware entity-primarily based enrichment algorithms and will extensively increase the quality of entity accessibility and temporal retrieval for Wikipedia. We formalize this problem case and conduct comprehensive experiments on a real dataset of 1.8 million Wikipedia articles in order to show the effectiveness of our proposed answer. Furthermore, we suggest a new event validation automatic method relying on a supervised model to predict the presence of events in a non-annotated corpus. As the extra document source for event validation, we chose the Web due to its ease of accessibility and wide event coverage. Our outcomes display that we are capable of acquiring 70% precision evaluated on a manually annotated corpus. Ultimately, we conduct a comparison of our strategy versus the Current Event Portal of Wikipedia and discover that our proposed WikipEvent along with the usage of Co-References technique may be utilized to provide new and more data on events.;,citation_author=Marco Fisichella;,citation_author=Andrea Ceroni;,citation_publication_date=2021-09;,citation_cover_date=2021-09;,citation_year=2021;,citation_fulltext_html_url=https://www.mdpi.com/2504-2289/5/3/34;,citation_issue=3;,citation_doi=10.3390/bdcc5030034;,citation_issn=2504-2289;,citation_volume=5;,citation_journal_title=Big Data and Cognitive Computing;">

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Good Faith Collaboration : The Culture of Wikipedia;,citation_abstract=How Wikipedia collaboration addresses the challenges of openness, consensus, and leadership in a historical pursuit for a universal encyclopedia. Wikipedia, the online encyclopedia, is built by a community—a community of Wikipedians who are expected to “assume good faith” when interacting with one another. In Good Faith Collaboration, Joseph Reagle examines this unique collaborative culture. Wikipedia, says Reagle, is not the first effort to create a freely shared, universal encyclopedia; its early twentieth-century ancestors include Paul Otlet’s Universal Repository and H. G. Wells’s proposal for a World Brain. Both these projects, like Wikipedia, were fuelled by new technology—which at the time included index cards and microfilm. What distinguishes Wikipedia from these and other more recent ventures is Wikipedia’s good-faith collaborative culture, as seen not only in the writing and editing of articles but also in their discussion pages and edit histories. Keeping an open perspective on both knowledge claims and other contributors, Reagle argues, creates an extraordinary collaborative potential. Wikipedia’s style of collaborative production has been imitated, analyzed, and satirized. Despite the social unease over its implications for individual autonomy, institutional authority, and the character (and quality) of cultural products, Wikipedia’s good-faith collaborative culture has brought us closer than ever to a realization of the century-old pursuit of a universal encyclopedia.;,citation_author=Joseph Reagle;,citation_publication_date=2010;,citation_cover_date=2010;,citation_year=2010;,citation_fulltext_html_url=https://directory.doabooks.org/handle/20.500.12854/77881;,citation_isbn=978-0-262-28971-9 978-0-262-01447-2;">

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Beyond History and Memory: New Perspectives in Memory Studies;,citation_abstract=This article outlines some recent achievements and new perspectives in contemporary memory studies. It first gives an overview of the recent handbooks and anthologies of memory studies, which testify to the institutionalisation of the young discipline. Then, it discusses the emergence of cultural memory studies, one of the most fruitful and promising trends in the memory studies of the last decade. And finally, it addresses the old debate over the relationship of history and memory, in order to propose an alternative conceptual framework for it and demonstrate the perspectives opened by a new avenue of research, mnemohistory. To conclude with, it argues that the rise of memory studies can be regarded as part of a broader change in how we nowadays see time and the interrelations of the past, the present and the future.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Wikipedia @ 20: Stories of an Incomplete Revolution;,citation_abstract=Wikipedia’s first twenty years: how what began as an experiment in collaboration became the world’s most popular reference work. We have been looking things up in Wikipedia for twenty years. What began almost by accident—a wiki attached to a nascent online encyclopedia—has become the world’s most popular reference work. Regarded at first as the scholarly equivalent of a Big Mac, Wikipedia is now known for its reliable sourcing and as a bastion of (mostly) reasoned interaction. How has Wikipedia, built on a model of radical collaboration, remained true to its original mission of “free access to the sum of all human knowledge” when other tech phenomena have devolved into advertising platforms? In this book, scholars, activists, and volunteers reflect on Wikipedia’s first twenty years, revealing connections across disciplines and borders, languages and data, the professional and personal. The contributors consider Wikipedia’s history, the richness of the connections that underpin it, and its founding vision. Their essays look at, among other things, the shift from bewilderment to respect in press coverage of Wikipedia; Wikipedia as “the most important laboratory for social scientific and computing research in history”; and the acknowledgment that “free access” includes not just access to the material but freedom to contribute—that the summation of all human knowledge is biased by who documents it.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=The DBpedia Events Dataset;,citation_abstract=Wikipedia is the largest encyclopedia worldwide and is frequently updated by thousands of collaborators. A large part of the knowledge in Wikipedia is not static, but frequently updated, e. g., political events or new movies. This makes Wikipedia an extremely rich, crowdsourced information hub for events. However, currently there is no structured and standardised way to access information on those events and it is cumbersome to filter and enrich them manually. We have created a dataset based on a live extraction of Wikipedia, which performs this task via rules for filtering and ranking updates in DBpedia Live.;,citation_author=Magnus Knuth;,citation_author=Jens Lehmann;,citation_author=D.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Visual Narratives and Collective Memory across Peer-Produced Accounts of Contested Sociopolitical Events;,citation_abstract=Studying cultural variation in recollections of sociopolitical events is crucial for achieving diverse understandings of such events. To date, most studies in this area have focused on analyzing variation in texts describing events. Here, we analyze variation in image usage across Wikipedia language editions to understand if, like text, visual narratives reflect distinct perspectives in articles about culturally-tethered events. We focus on articles about coup d’états as an example of highly contextual sociopolitical events likely to display such variation. The key challenge to examining variation in images is that there is no existing framework to use as a basis for comparison. To address this challenge, we use an iterative inductive coding process to arrive at a 46-item typology for categorizing the content of images relating to contested sociopolitical events, and a typology of network motifs that characterizes structural patterns of image use. We apply these typologies in a large-scale quantitative analysis that establishes clusters of image themes, two detailed qualitative case studies comparing Wikipedia articles on coup d’états in Soviet Russia and Egypt, and four quantitative analyses clustering image themes by language usage at the article level. These analyses document variation in imagery around particular events and variation in tendencies across cultures. We find substantial cultural variation in both content and network structure. This study presents a novel methodological framework for uncovering culturally divergent perspective of political crises through imagery on Wikipedia.;,citation_author=Emily Porter;,citation_author=P.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=A Taxonomy of Knowledge Gaps for Wikimedia Projects (Second Draft);,citation_abstract=In January 2019, prompted by the Wikimedia Movement’s 2030 strategic direction, the Research team at the Wikimedia Foundation identified the need to develop a knowledge gaps index – a composite index to support the decision makers across the Wikimedia movement by providing: a framework to encourage structured and targeted brainstorming discussions; data on the state of the knowledge gaps across the Wikimedia projects that can inform decision making and assist with measuring the long term impact of large scale initiatives in the Movement. After its first release in July 2020, the Research team has developed the second complete draft of a taxonomy of knowledge gaps for the Wikimedia projects, as the first step towards building the knowledge gap index. We studied more than 250 references by scholars, researchers, practitioners, community members and affiliates – exposing evidence of knowledge gaps in readership, contributorship, and content of Wikimedia projects. We elaborated the findings and compiled the taxonomy of knowledge gaps in this paper, where we describe, group and classify knowledge gaps into a structured framework.

Our results point to the use of Wikipedia to (1) intensively document and connect historical and contemporary events, (2) collaboratively migrate activity to support coverage of new events, and (3) dynamically re-appraise pre-existing knowledge in the aftermath of new events. These findings reveal patterns of behavior that complement theories of collective memory and collective action and help explain how social computing systems can encode and retrieve knowledge about social movements as they unfold.;,citation_author=Marlon Twyman;,citation_author=Brian C.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Toward an epistemology of Wikipedia;,citation_abstract=Wikipedia (the “free online encyclopedia that anyone can edit”) is having a huge impact on how a great many people gather information about the world. So, it is important for epistemologists and information scientists to ask whether people are likely to acquire knowledge as a result of having access to this information source. In other words, is Wikipedia having good epistemic consequences? After surveying the various concerns that have been raised about the reliability of Wikipedia, this article argues that the epistemic consequences of people using Wikipedia as a source of information are likely to be quite good. According to several empirical studies, the reliability of Wikipedia compares favorably to the reliability of traditional encyclopedias. Furthermore, the reliability of Wikipedia compares even more favorably to the reliability of those information sources that people would be likely to use if Wikipedia did not exist (viz., Web sites that are as freely and easily accessible as Wikipedia). In addition, Wikipedia has a number of other epistemic virtues (e.g., power, speed, and fecundity) that arguably outweigh any deficiency in terms of reliability. Even so, epistemologists and information scientists should certainly be trying to identify changes (or alternatives) to Wikipedia that will bring about even better epistemic consequences. This article suggests that to improve Wikipedia, we need to clarify what our epistemic values are and to better understand why Wikipedia works as well as it does. Somebody who reads Wikipedia is “rather in the position of a visitor to a public restroom,” says Mr. McHenry, Britannica’s former editor. “It may be obviously dirty, so that he knows to exercise great care, or it may seem fairly clean, so that he may be lulled into a false sense of security. What he certainly does not know is who has used the facilities before him.” One wonders whether people like Mr. McHenry would prefer there to be no public lavatories at all.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Fixing the floating gap: The online encyclopaedia Wikipedia as a global memory place;,citation_abstract=The article proposes to interpret the web-based encyclopaedia Wikipedia as a global memory place. After presenting the core elements and basic characteristics of wikis and Wikipedia respectively, the article discusses four related issues of social memory studies: collective memory, communicative and cultural memory, “memory places” and the “floating gap”. In a third step, these theoretical premises are connected to the understanding of discourse as social cognition. Fourth, comparison is made between the potential of the World Wide Web as cyberspace for collective remembrance and the obstacles that stand in its way. On this basis, the article argues that Wikipedia presents a global memory place where memorable elements are negotiated. Its complex processes of discussion and article creation are a model of the discursive fabrication of memory.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Wikipedia: A self-organizing bureaucracy;,citation_abstract=Many authors have argued that digital technologies enable collaboration without central oversight or authority, obviating the need for the hierarchical bureaucracies that characterize industrial capitalism. In this context, Wikipedia is often mentioned as a paradigmatic example. We draw on the classical accounts of Robert Michels and Max Weber to study mechanisms pushing towards or away from power concentration and bureaucratization. Our historical analysis of bureaucratization and power concentration in Wikipedia is based on 118 conversations and interviews as well as extensive archival research. While most studies on Wikipedia only consider the online encyclopedia itself, we also scrutinize the Wikimedia Foundation. Our analysis uncovers alternating processes of power concentration and power diffusion. While we observe power concentration for reasons anticipated by Michels, we also find strong counter-tendencies. Consequently, power concentration does not follow an “iron law” but is the contingent outcome of struggles among stakeholders. In line with Weber, we identify a process of progressive bureaucratization. This does not only result from the pursuit of organizational manageability, but from a quest for democratic equality and minimization of domination as well. We introduce the concept of self-organizing bureaucratization to highlight how bureaucratization is the unintended and emergent outcome of efforts to increase democratic accountability.;,citation_author=Emiel Rijshouwer;,citation_author=Justus Uitermark;,citation_author=Willem Koster;,citation_publication_date=2021-10;,citation_cover_date=2021-10;,citation_year=2021;,citation_fulltext_html_url=https://doi.org/10.1080/1369118X.2021.1994633;,citation_issue=0;,citation_doi=10.1080/1369118X.2021.1994633;,citation_issn=1369-118X;,citation_volume=0;,citation_journal_title=Information, Communication &amp;amp;amp; Society;">

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Beyond the Grey Zone: Organization Research Publishing and Bibliodiversity in the Research Communication System;,citation_abstract=Research publishing involves the production, use and management of research in a variety of genres and formats by commercial and non-profit academic publishers, and by organizations in government, civil society, university and industry sectors. However discussion of research publishing mainly tends to focus on the production and circulation of peer-reviewed academic journals and to a lesser extent books produced by commercial academic publishers. Research reports and papers produced by organizations outside the formal publishing system play a critical role in the research and development (R&amp;amp;amp;D) system, yet they are often overlooked in studies on open scholarship and research communication. This is partly due to a lack of terminology to adequately describe the diverse publishing practices of organizations which operate across a spectrum from formal to informal economic activity. In this article I define and contextualise research publishing by organizations in relation to other forms of academic publishing and recent calls for greater bibliodiversity in scholarly communication. Commonly used terms such as “grey literature” or “unpublished literature” are inadequate to describe and account for the proliferation and importance of diverse research genres and formats able to be produced, published and disseminated in print and online by think tanks, government agencies, industry bodies and research centres. By taking a more holistic, systems-oriented approach to research publishing we can begin to understand the diverse actors, institutions and practices involved in knowledge production and develop appropriate policies, infrastructure and management practices to support an effective, efficient, equitable, credible and sustainable research knowledge commons in the public interest.;,citation_author=Amanda Lawrence;,citation_publication_date=2021-11;,citation_cover_date=2021-11;,citation_year=2021;,citation_fulltext_html_url=https://popjournal.ca/issue03/lawrence;,citation_issue=3;,citation_journal_title=Pop!

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Wikipedia and history: A worthwhile partnership in the digital era?;,citation_abstract=It is hard to ignore the changes that have occurred to history-making in the digital age. Historians in the academy have observed, critiqued and, in some instances, engaged in the different forms of contemporary history that are related to the integration of the internet and related technologies into everyday lives. While digital history takes many forms, this paper examines Wikipedia as a mode of historical expression in the context of a project on the history of the Australian Paralympic Movement. Wikipedia’s key core content policies of verification, no original research, and neutral point of view (NPOV) as well as the collaborative premise that underpins the online encyclopaedia are the focal points of analysis. This analysis demonstrates that Wikipedia challenges historians who have traditionally produced the professionally approved artefacts of monographs and journal articles. In essence, Wikipedia requires historians to produce knowledge as part of a collaborative community of practice and, in the process, abandon popular theories of truth that underpin empirical-analytical history. Even given these challenges, the history of the Australian Paralympic Movement shows that Wikipedia can be important to history-making in the digital age in at least two ways. Wikipedia provides a mode of historical expression that is complementary to the narratives of traditional books, and the online encyclopaedia generates a community which has produced articles that have enhanced knowledge about the history of disability sport.;,citation_author=Murray G.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Witnessing Australian Stories: History, Testimony, and Memory in Contemporary Culture;,citation_abstract=This book is about how Australians have responded to stories about suffering and injustice in Australia, presented in a range of public media, including literature, history, films, and television. Those who have responded are both ordinary and prominent Australians—politicians, writers, and scholars. All have sought to come to terms with Australia’s history by responding empathetically to stories of its marginalized citizens.Drawing upon international scholarship on collective memory, public history, testimony, and witnessing, this book represents a cultural history of contemporary Australia. It examines the forms of witnessing that dominated Australian public culture at the turn of the millennium. Since the late 1980s, witnessing has developed in Australia in response to the increasingly audible voices of indigenous peoples, migrants, and more recently, asylum seekers. As these voices became public, they posed a challenge not only to scholars and politicians, but also, most importantly, to ordinary citizens.When former Prime Minister Kevin Rudd delivered his historic apology to Australia’s indigenous peoples in February 2008, he performed an act of collective witnessing that affirmed the testimony and experiences of Aboriginal Australians. The phenomenon of witnessing became crucial, not only to the recognition and reparation of past injustices, but to efforts to create a more cosmopolitan Australia in the present. This is a vital addition to Transaction’s critically acclaimed Memory and Narrative series.;,citation_author=Kelly Jean Butler;,citation_publication_date=2017-10;,citation_cover_date=2017-10;,citation_year=2017;,citation_doi=10.4324/9781315135809;,citation_isbn=978-1-315-13580-9;">

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Being Australian: Narratives of national identity;,citation_abstract=After a century of speculation by writers, filmmakers, travelers and scholars, being Australian’ has become a recognisable shorthand for a group of national characteristics. Now, in an era of international terrorism, being seen as un-Australian’ has become a potent rhetorical weapon for some, and a badge of honour for others.Catriona Elder explores the origins, meaning and effects of the many stories we tell about ourselves, and how they have changed over time. She outlines some of the traditional stories and their role in Australian nationalism, and she shows how concepts of egalitarianism, peaceful settlement and sporting prowess have been used to create a national identity. Elder also investigates the cultural and social perspectives that have been used to critique dominant accounts of Australian identity, including ideas of class, gender, sexuality, ethnicity and race. She shows how these critiques have been, in turn, queried in recent years. Being Australian is an ideal introduction to studying Australia for anyone interested in understanding Australian society, culture and history. A clever work: incisive and original. At a time when Australian identities have never been more debated, Elder finds an open way through the closed doors which often restrict cultural representations of Australian-ness.’Professor Adam Shoemaker, Dean of Arts, ANU This is a timely and significant new analysis essential reading on issues of identity and our own anxieties about national belonging and what it means to be Australian’ in a globalising world.’Kate Darian-Smith, Professor of Australian Studies and History, University of Melbourne;,citation_author=Catriona Elder;,citation_publication_date=2020-07;,citation_cover_date=2020-07;,citation_year=2020;,citation_doi=10.4324/9781003115045;,citation_isbn=978-1-00-311504-5;">

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Making Australian history;,citation_abstract=Australian history has been revised and reinterpreted by successive generations of historians, writers, governments and public commentators, yet there has been no account of the ways it has changed, who makes history, and how. Making Australian History responds to this critical gap in Australian historical research.A few years ago Anna Clark saw a series of paintings on a sandstone cliff face in the Northern Territory. There were characteristic crosshatched images of fat barramundi and turtles, as well as sprayed handprints and several human figures with spears. Next to them was a long gun, painted with white ochre, an unmistakable image of the colonisers. Was this an Indigenous rendering of contact? A work of history?Each piece of history has a message and context that depends on who wrote it and when. Australian history has swirled and contorted over the years: the history wars have embroiled historians, politicians and public commentators alike, while debates over historical fiction have been as divisive. History isn’t just about understanding what happened and why. It also reflects the persuasions, politics and prejudices of its authors. Each iteration of Australia’s national story reveals not only the past in question, but also the guiding concerns and perceptions of each generation of history makers.Making Australian History is bold and inclusive: it catalogues and contextualises changing readings of the past, it examines the increasingly problematic role of historians as national storytellers, and it incorporates the stories of people;,citation_author=Anna Clark;,citation_publication_date=2022;,citation_cover_date=2022;,citation_year=2022;,citation_isbn=978-1-76089-851-9;">

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Is Wikipedia growing a longer tail?;,citation_abstract=Wikipedia has millions of articles, many of which receive little attention. One group of Wikipedians believes these obscure entries should be removed because they are uninteresting and neglected; these are the deletionists. Other Wikipedians disagree, arguing that this long tail of articles is precisely Wikipedia’s advantage over other encyclopedias; these are the inclusionists. This paper looks at two overarching questions on the debate between deletionists and inclusionists: (1) What are the implications to the long tail of the evolving standards for article birth and death? (2) How is viewership affected by the decreasing notability of articles in the long tail? The answers to five detailed research questions that are inspired by these overarching questions should help better frame this debate and provide insight into how Wikipedia is evolving.;,citation_author=Shyong (Tony) K.

Our research confirms that gender inequality is a phenomenon with a long history, but whose patterns can be analyzed and quantified on a larger scale than previously thought possible. Through the use of Inglehart?Welzel cultural clusters, we show that gender inequality can be analyzed with regard to world?s cultures. We also show a steadily improving trend in the coverage of women and other genders in reference works.;,citation_author=Piotr Konieczny;,citation_author=Maximilian Klein;,citation_publication_date=2018-12;,citation_cover_date=2018-12;,citation_year=2018;,citation_fulltext_html_url=https://doi.org/10.1177/1461444818779080;,citation_issue=12;,citation_doi=10.1177/1461444818779080;,citation_issn=1461-4448;,citation_volume=20;,citation_journal_title=New Media &amp;amp;amp; Society;">
<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=The Ladies Vanish?: American Sociology and the Genealogy of its Missing Women on Wikipedia;,citation_abstract=Abstract Many notable female sociologists have vanished from the canonical history of American sociology. As the most influential crowd-sourced encyclopedia, Wikipedia promises – but does not necessarily deliver – a democratic corrective to the generation of knowledge, including academic knowledge. This article explores multiple mechanisms by which women either enter or disappear from the disciplinary record by analyzing the unfolding interaction between the canonical disciplinary history of sociology and Wikipedia. We argue that the uneven representation of women sociologists as (1) remembered, (2) neglected, (3) erased or, finally, (4) recovered is shaped by the emerging interactional space of knowledge production.;,citation_author=Wei Luo;,citation_author=Julia Adams;,citation_author=Hannah Brueckner;,citation_publication_date=2018-08;,citation_cover_date=2018-08;,citation_year=2018;,citation_fulltext_html_url=https://brill.com/view/journals/coso/17/5/article-p519_3.xml;,citation_issue=5;,citation_doi=10.1163/15691330-12341471;,citation_issn=1569-1322, 1569-1330;,citation_volume=17;,citation_journal_title=Comparative Sociology;">
<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Ms. Categorized: Gender, notability, and inequality on Wikipedia;,citation_abstract=Gender is one of the most pervasive and insidious forms of inequality. For example, English-language Wikipedia contains more than 1.5 million biographies about notable writers, inventors, and academics, but less than 19% of these biographies are about women. To try and improve these statistics, activists host ?edit-a-thons? to increase the visibility of notable women. While this strategy helps create several biographies previously inexistent, it fails to address a more inconspicuous form of gender exclusion. Drawing on ethnographic observations, interviews, and quantitative analysis of web-scraped metadata, this article demonstrates that biographies about women who meet Wikipedia?s criteria for inclusion are more frequently considered non-notable and nominated for deletion compared to men?s biographies. This disproportionate rate is another dimension of gender inequality previously unexplored by social scientists and provides broader insights into how women?s achievements are (under)valued.;,citation_author=Francesca Tripodi;,citation_publication_date=2021-06;,citation_cover_date=2021-06;,citation_year=2021;,citation_fulltext_html_url=https://doi.org/10.1177/14614448211023772;,citation_doi=10.1177/14614448211023772;,citation_issn=1461-4448;,citation_journal_title=New Media &amp;amp;amp; Society;">
<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Cultural Memory and Early Civilization: Writing, Remembrance, and Political Imagination;,citation_abstract=Now available to an English-speaking audience, this book presents a groundbreaking theoretical analysis of memory, identity and culture. It investigates how cultures remember, arguing that human memory exists and is communicated in two ways, namely inter-human interaction and in external systems of notation, such as writing, which can span generations. Dr Assmann defines two theoretical concepts of cultural memory, differentiating between the long-term memory of societies, which can span up to 3,000 years, and communicative memory, which is typically restricted to 80 to 100 years. He applies this theoretical framework to case studies of four specific cultures, illustrating the function contexts and specific achievements, including the state, international law, religion and science. Ultimately, his research demonstrates that memory is not simply a means of retaining information, but rather a force that can shape cultural identity and allow cultures to respond creatively to both daily challenges and catastrophic changes.;,citation_author=Jan Assmann;,citation_publication_date=2011;,citation_cover_date=2011;,citation_year=2011;,citation_fulltext_html_url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/cultural-memory-and-early-civilization/BCCB31EDCBF10BAF4F9B084B4BC6E5A7;,citation_doi=10.1017/CBO9780511996306;,citation_isbn=978-0-521-76381-3;">

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=WP:NOT, WP:NPOV, and Other Stories Wikipedia Tells Us: A Feminist Critique of Wikipedia’s Epistemology;,citation_abstract=Wikipedia has become increasingly prominent in online search results, serving as an initial path for the public to access ?facts,? and lending plausibility to its autobiographical claim to be ?the sum of all human knowledge.? However, this self-conception elides Wikipedia?s role as the world?s largest online site of encyclopedic knowledge production. A repository for established facts, Wikipedia is also a social space in which the facts themselves are decided. As a community, Wikipedia is guided by the five pillars?principles that inform and undergird the prevailing epistemic and social norms and practices for Wikipedia participation and contributions. We contend these pillars lend structural support to and help entrench Wikipedia?s gender gap as well as its lack of diversity in both participation and content. In upholding these pillars, Wikipedians may unknowingly undermine otherwise reasonable calls for inclusivity, subsequently reproducing systemic biases. We propose an alternative set of pillars developed through the lens of feminist epistemology, drawing on Lorraine Code?s notion of epistemic responsibility and Helen Longino?s notion of procedural objectivity. Our aim is not only to reduce bias, but also to make Wikipedia a more robust, reliable, and transparent site for knowledge production.;,citation_author=Amanda Menking;,citation_author=Jon Rosenberg;,citation_publication_date=2021-05;,citation_cover_date=2021-05;,citation_year=2021;,citation_fulltext_html_url=https://doi.org/10.1177/0162243920924783;,citation_issue=3;,citation_doi=10.1177/0162243920924783;,citation_issn=0162-2439;,citation_volume=46;,citation_journal_title=Science, Technology, &amp;amp;amp; Human Values;">

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Pressed for time: The acceleration of life in digital capitalism;,citation_abstract=The technologically tethered, iPhone-addicted figure is an image we can easily conjure. Most of us complain that there aren’t enough hours in the day and too many e-mails in our thumb-accessible inboxes. This widespread perception that life is faster than it used to be is now ingrained in our culture, and smartphones and the Internet are continually being blamed. But isn’t the sole purpose of the smartphone to give us such quick access to people and information that we’ll be free to do other things? Isn’t technology supposed to make our lives easier? In Pressed for Time, Judy Wajcman explains why we immediately interpret our experiences with digital technology as inexorably accelerating everyday life. She argues that we are not mere hostages to communication devices, and the sense of always being rushed is the result of the priorities and parameters we ourselves set rather than the machines that help us set them. Indeed, being busy and having action-packed lives has become valorized by our productivity driven culture. Wajcman offers a bracing historical perspective, exploring the commodification of clock time, and how the speed of the industrial age became identified with progress. She also delves into the ways time-use differs for diverse groups in modern societies, showing how changes in work patterns, family arrangements, and parenting all affect time stress. Bringing together empirical research on time use and theoretical debates about dramatic digital developments, this accessible and engaging book will leave readers better versed in how to use technology to navigate life’s fast lane.;,citation_author=Judy Wajcman;,citation_publication_date=2015;,citation_cover_date=2015;,citation_year=2015;,citation_doi=10.7208/9780226196503;,citation_isbn=978-0-226-19650-3;">

In any given month, the site’s most popular articles — both in number of views and number of edits — are those reporting breaking news.

The online presence of the writing of history is increasing, and this potential would be a welcome development for the field as it would create a much richer set of easily available historical perspectives. However, this article suggests that the achievement of this promise is fraught with difficulty and that a more likely outcome is a mapping of the status quo in historical representation onto the new media. To illustrate this, I present an analysis of the Wikipedia accounts of Singaporean and Philippine history. For Singapore, alternative historical visions are not as developed as those for the Philippines, and this is reflected in the nature of the respective Wikipedia accounts. I suggest that a possible means to achieve something more of the promise of digital media for history is for information professionals to take a keener interest in Wikipedia, with an eye to helping include accounts of documented historical perspectives that are ignored by mainstream historiographical traditions.;,citation_author=Brendan Luyt;,citation_publication_date=2011;,citation_cover_date=2011;,citation_year=2011;,citation_fulltext_html_url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/asi.21531;,citation_issue=6;,citation_doi=10.1002/asi.21531;,citation_issn=1532-2890;,citation_volume=62;,citation_journal_title=Journal of the American Society for Information Science and Technology;">

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Two Wikipedias in Bhutan: Problems and solutions for knowledge equity in the digital age;,citation_abstract=The growing influence of English Wikipedia as a provider of information has created powerful new gatekeepers and publishing practices that determine not only what constitutes knowledge in the online world, but whose knowledge is privileged. The structural inequalities of the offline world are being reproduced online, creating new sites for information imperialism. Research shows western contributors are overwriting local knowledge, perpetuating western narratives, and presenting cultures through an outsider lens, resulting in subtle and not so subtle forms of hegemonic cultural dominance. Nonetheless, Wikipedias have multi-media capabilities, which can be utilized by oral cultures as well as providing new asynchronous online meeting places where communities can continue their social imaginings. This paper considers the impacts of English Wikipedia on global knowledge equity and cognitive justice. It analyzes two articles about Bhutanese culture to demonstrate the risks of dilution brought by western ontological expansiveness, and argues that, by contrast, the Dzongkha Wikipedia offers an online space mostly inaccessible to outsiders, and thus a bulwark where the community can continue its cultural conversations in ways not possible before Web 2.0 technologies.;,citation_author=Bunty Avieson;,citation_publication_date=2022-09;,citation_cover_date=2022-09;,citation_year=2022;,citation_fulltext_html_url=https://doi.org/10.1080/01292986.2021.1937248;,citation_issue=5;,citation_doi=10.1080/01292986.2021.1937248;,citation_issn=0129-2986;,citation_volume=32;,citation_journal_title=Asian Journal of Communication;">

Nevertheless, Wikipedia articles influence legal judgments, as we show using a randomized control trial.We find that the presence of a Wikipedia article about Irish Supreme Court decisions makes it meaningfully more likely that the corresponding case will be cited as a precedent by judges in subsequent decisions. The language used in the Wikipedia article also influences the language used in judgments. These effects are only present for citations by the High Court, not for the higher levels of the judiciary (Court of Appeal and Supreme Court). Since the High Court faces higher caseloads, this may indicate that settings with greater time pressures encourage greater reliance on Wikipedia.Our results add to the growing recognition that Wikipedia and other frequently-accessed sources of user-generated content have profound effects on important social outcomes.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=The Gender Divide in Wikipedia: Quantifying and Assessing the Impact of Two Feminist Interventions;,citation_abstract=Wikipedia has a well-known gender divide affecting its biographical content. This bias not only shapes social perceptions of knowledge, but it can also propagate beyond the platform as its contents are leveraged to correct misinformation, train machine-learning tools, and enhance search engine results. What happens when feminist movements intervene to try to close existing gaps? Through a quantitative analysis of over 11,000 Wikipedia articles, we provide an evaluation of two popular feminist interventions designed to counteract gender inequality within digital information projects. We find that the interventions are successful at adding content about women that would otherwise be missing, but they are less successful at addressing structural biases that limit the visibility of that content. This leads us to argue for a more granular and cumulative analysis of gender gaps in collaborative environments. We also discuss the implications for future scholarship on digital inequalities.;,citation_author=Isabelle Langrock;,citation_author=Sandra González-Bailón;,citation_publication_date=2022-06;,citation_cover_date=2022-06;,citation_year=2022;,citation_fulltext_html_url=https://doi.org/10.1093/joc/jqac004;,citation_issue=3;,citation_doi=10.1093/joc/jqac004;,citation_issn=0021-9916;,citation_volume=72;,citation_journal_title=Journal of Communication;">
<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Controlled Analyses of Social Biases in Wikipedia Bios;,citation_abstract=Social biases on Wikipedia, a widely-read global platform, could greatly influence public opinion. While prior research has examined man/woman gender bias in biography articles, possible influences of other demographic attributes limit conclusions. In this work, we present a methodology for analyzing Wikipedia pages about people that isolates dimensions of interest (e.g., gender), from other attributes (e.g., occupation). Given a target corpus for analysis (e.g. biographies about women), we present a method for constructing a comparison corpus that matches the target corpus in as many attributes as possible, except the target one. We develop evaluation metrics to measure how well the comparison corpus aligns with the target corpus and then examine how articles about gender and racial minorities (cis. women, non-binary people, transgender women, and transgender men; African American, Asian American, and Hispanic/Latinx American people) differ from other articles. In addition to identifying suspect social biases, our results show that failing to control for covariates can result in different conclusions and veil biases. Our contributions include methodology that facilitates further analyses of bias in Wikipedia articles, findings that can aid Wikipedia editors in reducing biases, and a framework and evaluation metrics to guide future work in this area.;,citation_author=Anjalie Field;,citation_author=Chan Young Park;,citation_author=Kevin Z.

Anyone with access to the Web is able to play a part on Wikipedia, an open and free encyclopedia, and arguably one of the primary sources of knowledge on the Web. In this paper, we study gender bias in Wikipedia in terms of how women and men are characterized in their biographies. To do so, we analyze biographical content in three aspects: meta-data, language, and network structure. Our results show that, indeed, there are differences in characterization and structure. Some of these differences are reflected from the off-line world documented by Wikipedia, but other differences can be attributed to gender bias in Wikipedia content. We contextualize these differences in social theory and discuss their implications for Wikipedia policy.;,citation_author=Eduardo Graells-Garrido;,citation_author=Mounia Lalmas;,citation_author=Filippo Menczer;,citation_publication_date=2015-08;,citation_cover_date=2015-08;,citation_year=2015;,citation_fulltext_html_url=https://doi.org/10.1145/2700171.2791036;,citation_doi=10.1145/2700171.2791036;,citation_isbn=978-1-4503-3395-5;,citation_conference_title=Proceedings of the 26th ACM Conference on Hypertext &amp;amp;amp; Social Media;,citation_conference=Association for Computing Machinery;,citation_series_title=HT ’15;">

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Big Data and the brave new world of social media research;,citation_abstract=The recent Facebook study about emotional contagion has generated a high-profile debate about the ethical and social issues in Big Data research. These issues are not unprecedented, but the debate highlighted that, in focusing on research ethics and the legal issues about this type of research, an important larger picture is overlooked about the extent to which free will is compatible with the growth of deterministic scientific knowledge, and how Big Data research has become central to this growth of knowledge. After discussing the ?emotional contagion study? as an illustration, these larger issues about Big Data and scientific knowledge are addressed by providing definitions of data, Big Data and of how scientific knowledge changes the human-made environment. Against this background, it will be possible to examine why the uses of data-driven analyses of human behaviour in particular have recently experienced rapid growth. The essay then goes on to discuss the distinction between basic scientific research as against applied research, a distinction which, it is argued, is necessary to understand the quite different implications in the context of scientific as opposed to applied research. Further, it is important to recognize that Big Data analyses are both enabled and constrained by the nature of data sources available. Big Data research is bound to become more widespread, and this will require more awareness on the part of data scientists, policymakers and a wider public about its contexts and often unintended consequences.;,citation_author=Ralph Schroeder;,citation_publication_date=2014-07;,citation_cover_date=2014-07;,citation_year=2014;,citation_fulltext_html_url=https://doi.org/10.1177/2053951714563194;,citation_issue=2;,citation_doi=10.1177/2053951714563194;,citation_issn=2053-9517;,citation_volume=1;,citation_journal_title=Big Data &amp;amp;amp; Society;">

Such projects, and the edit-a-thons that continue to be convened in Wadewitz’s honour, help to reconcile the imbalance and simultaneously present pedagogical opportunities. Drawing upon scholarly literature, this paper also illustrates how Wikipedia editing supports and reinforces the principles of both academic and public writing and represents an open and sustainable platform for formative and summative assessment.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Studying Up Machine Learning Data: Why Talk About Bias When We Mean Power?;,citation_abstract=Research in machine learning (ML) has argued that models trained on incomplete or biased datasets can lead to discriminatory outputs. In this commentary, we propose moving the research focus beyond bias-oriented framings by adopting a power-aware perspective to &amp;amp;amp;quot;study up&amp;quot; ML datasets. This means accounting for historical inequities, labor conditions, and epistemological standpoints inscribed in data. We draw on HCI and CSCW work to support our argument, critically analyze previous research, and point at two co-existing lines of work within our research community \,—\,one bias-centered, the other power-aware. We highlight the need for dialogue and cooperation in three areas: data quality, data work, and data documentation. In the first area, we argue that reducing societal problems to &quot;bias&quot; misses the context-based nature of data. In the second one, we highlight the corporate forces and market imperatives involved in the labor of data workers that subsequently shape ML datasets.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=The discovery of “unpaid work”: The social consequences of the expansion of “work”;,citation_abstract=This paper questions the dichotomy of work/nonwork. It examines the way in which the category of work was expanded by feminists and economists to include much domestic activity, and considers some of the consequences of this expansion. It argues that the discovery of unpaid &amp;amp;amp;quot;work&amp;quot; involved an uncritical application and validation of a concept of work abstracted from a model of commodity producing wage labor in manufacturing. However, this concept excludes much of what is distinctive about domestic activities, such as their caring and self-fulfilling aspects. Inequality between households has become a conduit for the construction of needs in a form in which &quot;work,&quot; and in particular work for money, is needed to satisfy them. Some consequences of this tendency are examined together with the policy concerns which would need to be addressed in order to mitigate its deleterious effects. The development of a feminist economics which transcends the polarization of life into &quot;work&quot; and &quot;nonwork&quot; is argued to be vital in this process.;,citation_author=Susan Himmelweit;,citation_publication_date=1995-07;,citation_cover_date=1995-07;,citation_year=1995;,citation_fulltext_html_url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/714042229;,citation_issue=2;,citation_doi=10.1080/714042229;,citation_issn=1354-5701, 1466-4372;,citation_volume=1;,citation_journal_title=Feminist Economics;">

E. H. Stanner famously articulated that the nation’s history had been wracked by a “great Australian silence” with regard to the recognition of Indigenous experience. Australia’s sense of its past, he argued, its very collective memory, had been built on a state of forgetting. Beyond that disciplinary silence, however, important historical “noise” was being made about Indigenous history. Popular historical fiction and poetry, Indigenous family histories and forms of popular protest all offered important counter-narratives to that formal silence from the History discipline. Scholarship in the fields of anthropology and archaeology further pressed against the silences and silencing of Australian History. This paper uses the idea of silence to complicate historiographical space in Australia. By contemplating formal History texts, vernacular historical accounts and history-making beyond the discipline, it seeks to extend our understandings of national historiographies and historical knowledge.;,citation_author=Anna Clark;,citation_publication_date=2020-07;,citation_cover_date=2020-07;,citation_year=2020;,citation_fulltext_html_url=https://doi.org/10.1080/02103702.2020.1771966;,citation_issue=3;,citation_doi=10.1080/02103702.2020.1771966;,citation_issn=0210-3702;,citation_volume=43;,citation_journal_title=Journal for the Study of Education and Development;">

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Wikipedia’s Intentional Distortion of the History of the Holocaust;,citation_abstract=This essay uncovers the systematic, intentional distortion of Holocaust history on the English-language Wikipedia, the world’s largest encyclopedia. In the last decade, a group of committed Wikipedia editors have been promoting a skewed version of history on Wikipedia, one touted by right-wing Polish nationalists, which whitewashes the role of Polish society in the Holocaust and bolsters stereotypes about Jews. Due to this group’s zealous handiwork, Wikipedia’s articles on the Holocaust in Poland minimize Polish antisemitism, exaggerate the Poles’ role in saving Jews, insinuate that most Jews supported Communism and conspired with Communists to betray Poles (Żydokomuna or Judeo–Bolshevism), blame Jews for their own persecution, and inflate Jewish collaboration with the Nazis. To explain how distortionist editors have succeeded in imposing this narrative, despite the efforts of opposing editors to correct it, we employ an innovative methodology. We examine 25 public-facing Wikipedia articles and nearly 300 of Wikipedia’s back pages, including talk pages, noticeboards, and arbitration cases. We complement these with interviews of editors in the field and statistical data gleaned through Wikipedia’s tool suites. This essay contributes to the study of Holocaust memory, revealing the digital mechanisms by which ideological zeal, prejudice, and bias trump reason and historical accuracy. More broadly, we break new ground in the field of the digital humanities, modelling an in-depth examination of how Wikipedia editors negotiate and manufacture information for the rest of the world to consume.;,citation_author=Jan Grabowski;,citation_author=Shira Klein;,citation_publication_date=2023-02;,citation_cover_date=2023-02;,citation_year=2023;,citation_fulltext_html_url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/25785648.2023.2168939;,citation_issue=0;,citation_doi=10.1080/25785648.2023.2168939;,citation_issn=2578-5648;,citation_volume=0;,citation_journal_title=The Journal of Holocaust Research;">

How are crowd-enabled networks activated, structured, and maintained in the absence of recognized leaders, common goals, or conventional organization, issue framing, and action coordination? We develop an analytical framework for examining the organizational processes of crowd-enabled connective action such as was found in the Arab Spring, the 15-M in Spain, and Occupy Wall Street. The analysis points to three elemental modes of peer production that operate together to create organization in crowds: the production, curation, and dynamic integration of various types of information content and other resources that become distributed and utilized across the crowd. Whereas other peer-production communities such as open-source software developers or Wikipedia typically evolve more highly structured participation environments, crowds create organization through packaging these elemental peer-production mechanisms to achieve various kinds of work. The workings of these “production packages” are illustrated with a theory-driven analysis of Twitter data from the 2011–2012 US Occupy movement, using an archive of some 60 million tweets. This analysis shows how the Occupy crowd produced various organizational routines, and how the different production mechanisms were nested in each other to create relatively complex organizational results.;,citation_author=W.

Have the ways we understand the past and the future—and their relationship to the present—been reordered? The past, it seems, has returned with a vengeance: as aggressive nostalgia, as traumatic memory, or as atavistic origin narratives rooted in nation, race, or tribe. The future, meanwhile, has lost its utopian glamor, with the belief in progress and hope for a better future eroded by fears of ecological collapse. In this provocative book, Aleida Assmann argues that the apparently solid moorings of our temporal orientation have collapsed within the span of a generation. To understand this profound cultural crisis, she reconstructs the rise and fall of what she calls &amp;amp;amp;quot;time regime of modernity&amp;quot; that underpins notions of modernization and progress, a shared understanding that is now under threat. Is Time Out of Joint? assesses the deep change in the temporality of modern Western culture as it relates to our historical experience, historical theory, and our life-world of shared experience, explaining what we have both gained and lost during this profound transformation.;,citation_author=Aleida Assmann;,citation_publication_date=2020;,citation_cover_date=2020;,citation_year=2020;,citation_fulltext_html_url=http://ebookcentral.proquest.com/lib/uts/detail.action?docID=5964894;,citation_isbn=978-1-5017-4245-3;">

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Beyond opening up the black box: Investigating the role of algorithmic systems in Wikipedian organizational culture;,citation_abstract=Scholars and practitioners across domains are increasingly concerned with algorithmic transparency and opacity, interrogating the values and assumptions embedded in automated, black-boxed systems, particularly in user-generated content platforms. I report from an ethnography of infrastructure in Wikipedia to discuss an often understudied aspect of this topic: the local, contextual, learned expertise involved in participating in a highly automated social–technical environment. Today, the organizational culture of Wikipedia is deeply intertwined with various data-driven algorithmic systems, which Wikipedians rely on to help manage and govern the “‘anyone can edit’” encyclopedia at a massive scale. These bots, scripts, tools, plugins, and dashboards make Wikipedia more efficient for those who know how to work with them, but like all organizational culture, newcomers must learn them if they want to fully participate. I illustrate how cultural and organizational expertise is enacted around algorithmic agents by discussing two autoethnographic vignettes, which relate my personal experience as a veteran in Wikipedia. I present thick descriptions of how governance and gatekeeping practices are articulated through and in alignment with these automated infrastructures. Over the past 15 years, Wikipedian veterans and administrators have made specific decisions to support administrative and editorial workflows with automation in particular ways and not others. I use these cases of Wikipedia’s bot-supported bureaucracy to discuss several issues in the fields of critical algorithms studies; critical data studies; and fairness, accountability, and transparency in machine learning—most principally arguing that scholarship and practice must go beyond trying to “‘open up the black box’” of such systems and also examine sociocultural processes like newcomer socialization.;,citation_author=R Stuart Geiger;,citation_publication_date=2017-12;,citation_cover_date=2017-12;,citation_year=2017;,citation_fulltext_html_url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/2053951717730735;,citation_issue=2;,citation_doi=10.1177/2053951717730735;,citation_issn=2053-9517, 2053-9517;,citation_volume=4;,citation_journal_title=Big Data &amp;amp;amp; Society;">

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=The Old and New of Digital History;,citation_abstract=This article reflects on the expectations and changes that digital technologies have brought to history, activities that are increasingly codified as digital history. Because of the breadth of digital technologies and communicative media, the contours of a digital history are still unclear, so I frame my discussion with two potential narratives that begin from different ideas that emerged from World War II weapons research. One narrative begins with Roberto Busa and the application of a computer to find concordances in the writings of Saint Thomas Aquinas. The emphasis here is on the application of computer technologies to the practice of history. The second narrative begins with Vannevar Bush’s essay “As We May Think” and focuses on digital technologies as a key element in an information system. This beginning invites a parallel between inscription technologies (especially the movable-type press) and knowledge systems. Both narratives imbibe the modern faith in technology to improve; the “new” is better, but the latter better involves humans and societies. Despite important differences between them, both narratives lead to an inquiry into the foundations of our modern knowledge system. In the case of history, the question is whether a knowledge system that was developed in the nineteenth century and designed to encompass and order the world into one system is still apposite in our digital world. I close by suggesting that one such presumption that needs to be reconsidered is the idea of the past as a prior and distant time-form. A shift from “the past” to “pasts” opens history to a broader field of previous happenings and a reconsideration of chronological time, of change, and to other modes of transmission, such as storytelling.;,citation_author=Stefan Tanaka;,citation_publication_date=2022;,citation_cover_date=2022;,citation_year=2022;,citation_fulltext_html_url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/hith.12284;,citation_issue=4;,citation_doi=10.1111/hith.12284;,citation_issn=1468-2303;,citation_volume=61;,citation_journal_title=History and Theory;">
<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Composing History for the Web: Digital Reformulation of Narrative, Evidence, and Context;,citation_abstract=I recently published A New Vision for Islamic Pasts and Futures, a digital book that presents a new way to understand Islam. This article describes the process and conceptual work that went into designing the book’s interface. It emphasizes that hypertext enabled through digital means is not intrinsically more dynamic than print since work in both forms requires equally intensive hermeneutical effort. However, the digital realm provides a more expansive spectrum of tools to formulate concepts and to build on them. Digital presentation can be integrated into processes of theorizing, describing, and advocating that form the core of scholarship in the humanities. The article focuses on three areas—narrative, evidence, and context—that are central to modern historical work. My book’s interface demonstrates that web capabilities are compositional tools whose deployment should be mulled over in a manner similar to how authors treat writing and editing. Moreover, we should take account of the quotidian fact that, in our environment, information and knowledge reach us extensively via computer-based mediation. Whether in books or in articles, academic work is assimilated through piecemeal delivery rather than bound volumes. Instead of romanticizing traditional forms whose import may be diminishing, historians and other humanities scholars can create new arguments by being attentive to the web’s capabilities and to the current social conditions of possibility pertaining to the circulation of knowledge. Facility with digital composition can then feed back into all forms of humanistic thinking and writing.;,citation_author=Shahzad Bashir;,citation_publication_date=2022;,citation_cover_date=2022;,citation_year=2022;,citation_fulltext_html_url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/hith.12275;,citation_issue=4;,citation_doi=10.1111/hith.12275;,citation_issn=1468-2303;,citation_volume=61;,citation_journal_title=History and Theory;">
<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Historical Practice in the Era of Digital History;,citation_abstract=The current digital historical moment is an opportunity to formulate a new theory of historical practice. Our field’s long-standing passive reliance on the widespread explanation of historical practice as deriving information from “primary sources” is unhelpful, incoherent, misleading, and an active inhibition to new opportunities. Our reliance on an incoherent explanation means our students are not given a precise description of our historical practice but instead learn to imitate us by gradually adopting disciplinary norms conveyed through exemplary models and the critique of work performed. Furthermore, our reliance on a misleading explanation of method means we lack a common terminology with which we all can coherently explain to our peers what we actually do. We know this, and yet we have provided no alternative. The current moment offers an opportunity to provide a theory of the practice of history that encompasses contemporary, traditional, and even ancient historical methods: capturing sources, producing data, and creating facts. Wide acceptance and implementation of a sources-data-facts model of historical practice will accelerate student understanding, improve communication with other disciplines, erase the apparent distinction between (so-called) analog and digital history, and provide a framework for the publication of historical data as a valuable end in and of itself.;,citation_author=Jesse W.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=History as Antidote: The Argument for Documentation in Digital History;,citation_abstract=The ephemeral nature of computer-enabled historical work is a well-documented concern within the field of history. The quick pace of technological change often renders digital scholarship obsolete, which in turn encourages historians to retreat to the stable and durable comfort of print, even as digital methodologies enrich our research and expand the audience for it. What has been missing so far in the conversation about digital history is a clear understanding of how it differs from traditional historical products, what can be gained from it, and how we might document the work undertaken using these machine-based methodologies. Because it is best understood as a process rather than as a product, digital history must have a history of its own to tether it to the scholarly community and to ensure that it endures past the active phase of any project. This article argues that digital historians should catalog their work using a normalized template following the Digital Documentation Process, a guide for producing documentation that is suitable for computer-based historical scholarship and tailored to its specific parameters. Self-documentation is beneficial to those who create digital history and those who consume it. It is urgent to establish a field-wide expectation that digital history will be consistently documented as a matter of course, lest we lose scholarship that has already been produced and forgo the enormous opportunities that computer-enabled methodologies offer to historians.;,citation_author=Laura K.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Opening the Black Box of Interpretation: Digital History Practices as Models of Knowledge;,citation_abstract=Digital history is more than just the implementation of algorithmic and other data practices in the practice of history writing. It places our discipline under a microscope and enables us to focus in on what history writing is in the first place: writing about the past under specific social and societal conditions. This article argues for a closer look at the traditions of history writing in order to understand its principles and to determine what the digital condition contributes to historiography. Does the work of historians actually change in principle, or does digital history instead reflect the digital condition under which we operate? The article begins with a reflection on the works of Wilhelm Dilthey and Michel de Certeau to discuss how the society in which the historian writes influences the practices of interpretation. The article then presents what can be understood as the digital condition of our present societies and shows how algorithms function as “black boxes” that influence our social interactions, communication, and understanding of the world. The article’s third part brings together the earlier discussions of practices of history writing and the digital condition in order to examine the role of modeling for knowledge production in the sciences and the humanities. The closing argument then focuses on the use of visualizations in digital history as an example of the operational use of models of knowledge in opening the “black box” of interpretation.;,citation_author=Silke Schwandt;,citation_publication_date=2022;,citation_cover_date=2022;,citation_year=2022;,citation_fulltext_html_url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/hith.12281;,citation_issue=4;,citation_doi=10.1111/hith.12281;,citation_issn=1468-2303;,citation_volume=61;,citation_journal_title=History and Theory;">
<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=The Properties of Digital History;,citation_abstract=This article offers a definition of digital history that focuses on the core affordances of the personal computer and the process by which those properties come to be exploited. I begin by outlining the two properties of computers that I argue define digital history: they process data and (as Janet H. Murray noted) provide an immersive and interactive medium. I then examine how digital historians in the United States have employed those affordances. That process has proceeded unevenly, with computers having been used as a medium before they were employed to process data, and has produced additive forms—digital archives, digital public history, data analysis published in print—that rely on existing formats rather than on the affordances of computers. While such forms are a necessary step toward a more fully realized digital history, their prevalence suggests that it will take some time for that process to play out. The final section looks to recently published and forthcoming long-form digital arguments for the direction of that development. Examples from Stanford University Press’s Digital Projects series point to some of the ways that the data analysis and the immersive and interactive medium of the computer might be combined.;,citation_author=Stephen Robertson;,citation_publication_date=2022;,citation_cover_date=2022;,citation_year=2022;,citation_fulltext_html_url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/hith.12286;,citation_issue=4;,citation_doi=10.1111/hith.12286;,citation_issn=1468-2303;,citation_volume=61;,citation_journal_title=History and Theory;">
<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Toward the Recognition of Artificial History Makers;,citation_abstract=Artificial intelligence is a historical discipline. This does not simply mean that its history can be written. It is historical on account of its recursive basis for action: its systems turn to prior beliefs—often through multiple steps or layers—to make recommendations for the present or predictions for the future. Using the two rooms approach of Alan Turing’s imitation game, I highlight the potential for machine and human histories to be recognized via at least the idea of weak artificial intelligence. This recognition illuminates the mixed nature of the logic of history, combining deductions and endoxa. Finally, I note that illuminating and exploring this mixed logic of history signals a turn to historiographical metaphysics with Aristotelian features and, thus, the recognition of histories by professional historians as only part of a historiographical world. This signals that the recognition of machine and human history makers does not simply turn on the acknowledgement of imitation.;,citation_author=Marnie Hughes-Warrington;,citation_publication_date=2022;,citation_cover_date=2022;,citation_year=2022;,citation_fulltext_html_url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/hith.12278;,citation_issue=4;,citation_doi=10.1111/hith.12278;,citation_issn=1468-2303;,citation_volume=61;,citation_journal_title=History and Theory;">
<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Digital Doping for Historians: Can History, Memory, and Historical Theory Be Rendered Artificially In℡ligent?;,citation_abstract=Artificial intelligence is making history, literally. Machine learning tools are playing a key role in crafting images and stories about the past in popular culture. AI has probably also already invaded the history classroom. Large language models such as GPT-3 are able to generate compelling, non-plagiarized texts in response to simple natural language inputs, thus providing students with an opportunity to produce high-quality written assignments with minimum effort. In a similar vein, tools like GPT-3 are likely to revolutionize historical studies, enabling historians and other professionals who deal in texts to rely on AI-generated intermediate work products, such as accurate translations, summaries, and chronologies. But present-day large language models fail at key tasks that historians hold in high regard. They are structurally incapable of telling the truth and tracking pieces of information through layers of texts. What’s more, they lack ethical self-reflexivity. Therefore, for the time being, the writing of academic history will require human agency. But for historical theorists, large language models might offer an opportunity to test basic hypotheses about the nature of historical writing. Historical theorists can, for instance, have customized large language models write a series of descriptive, narrative, and assertive histories about the same events, thereby enabling them to explore the precise relation between description, narration, and argumentation in historical writing. In short, with specifically designed large language models, historical theorists can run the kinds of large-scale writing experiments that they could never put into practice with real historians.;,citation_author=Wulf Kansteiner;,citation_publication_date=2022;,citation_cover_date=2022;,citation_year=2022;,citation_fulltext_html_url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/hith.12282;,citation_issue=4;,citation_doi=10.1111/hith.12282;,citation_issn=1468-2303;,citation_volume=61;,citation_journal_title=History and Theory;">
<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Implicated Gaming: Choice and Complicity in Ludic Holocaust Memory;,citation_abstract=Holocaust memorial sites and institutions have begun to embrace new media and digital technologies as methods of communication, public engagement, and memorialization. Despite increasing numbers of interactive digital media projects focused on Holocaust education, there is a significant gulf between the topics addressed by digital Holocaust works and those conceptualized and studied at a higher level in scholarly Holocaust literature. Most notably, challenging questions regarding the categories of bystandership, complicity, and perpetration are largely ignored in favor of traditional victim-focused narratives. I suggest that, in their eagerness to adopt virtual reality (VR) and mixed reality (MR) technologies, digital Holocaust memory projects have neglected the significant potential of nonimmersive video games to address questions regarding bystandership and complicity. By moving away from the perceptual immersion of VR and toward the ludic and simulative arguments of video games, digitally interactive Holocaust projects may be able to lessen the risks of over-immersion and retraumatization that are antithetical to critical historical thinking and understanding. This article examines the 2013 game Papers, Please as an example of how video games can present sophisticated arguments about human agency, bystandership, and complicity. By placing players in a historical problem space laden with impossible moral choices, Papers, Please demonstrates the systemic forces that structure human behavior under extreme, violent, and authoritarian conditions. I argue that Holocaust-based ludic digital media modeled after Papers, Please could explore bystandership and complicity in similarly nuanced and powerful ways, potentially touching on academic Holocaust concepts such as the “choiceless choices” of “the gray zone.” Addressing these topics in ludic historical media could help to bridge the gap between popular and scholarly understandings of the Holocaust in the twenty-first century.;,citation_author=Tamika Glouftsis;,citation_publication_date=2022;,citation_cover_date=2022;,citation_year=2022;,citation_fulltext_html_url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/hith.12277;,citation_issue=4;,citation_doi=10.1111/hith.12277;,citation_issn=1468-2303;,citation_volume=61;,citation_journal_title=History and Theory;">
<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Historical Futures;,citation_abstract=This article outlines the agenda of a collective research project that aims to explore modalities of historical futures that constitute our current historical condition. To present the collective work adequately, we have teamed up with History and Theory and initiated a long-term serial publishing experiment. In the coming years, each issue of the journal will feature contributions to this research endeavor. In our project-opening piece, we briefly introduce the experiment and the premises of the collective research agenda. We begin by recounting the many ways in which increasingly towering novel future prospects have begun to capture the scholarly world’s attention across disciplinary boundaries. We then introduce the notion of historical futures. Crediting theoretical inspirations and paying intellectual debts to conceptual relatives, we define “historical futures” as the plurality of transitional relations between apprehensions of the past and anticipated futures. At the core of the article, we formulate our call for a collective investigation of modalities of historical futures and sketch three basic sets of concerns that the explorative works in this experiment may address: kinds of transitions from past to futures, kinds of anticipatory practices, and kinds of registers as interpretive tools that position such practices on a variety of spectrums between two poles (for instance, a value register with the poles of catastrophic and redemptive futures). Finally, we close with a brief note about the necessity of collective endeavors.;,citation_author=Zoltán Boldizsár Simon;,citation_author=Marek Tamm;,citation_publication_date=2021;,citation_cover_date=2021;,citation_year=2021;,citation_fulltext_html_url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/hith.12190;,citation_issue=1;,citation_doi=10.1111/hith.12190;,citation_issn=1468-2303;,citation_volume=60;,citation_journal_title=History and Theory;">
<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Entangled Memory: Toward a Third Wave in Memory Studies;,citation_abstract=This essay takes up the call for a “third phase” in memory studies and makes theoretical and methodological suggestions for its further development. Starting from an understanding of memory that centers on memory’s temporality, its relation to language, and its quality as a social action, the essay puts forward the concept of “entangled memory.” On a theoretical level, it brings to the fore the entangledness of acts of remembering. In a synchronic perspective, memory’s entangledness is presented as twofold. Every act of remembering inscribes an individual in multiple social frames. This polyphony entails the simultaneous existence of concurrent interpretations of the past. In a diachronic perspective, memory is entangled in the dynamic relation between single acts of remembering and changing mnemonic patterns. Memory scholars therefore uncover boundless cross-referential configurations. Wishing to enhance the dialogue between the theoretical and the empirical parts of memory studies, we propose four devices that serve as a heuristic in the study of memory’s entanglement: chronology against time, conflict, generations, and self-reflexivity. Current debates on European memory permit us to explore the possible benefits that the concept of entangled memory carries for memory studies.;,citation_author=Gregor Feindt;,citation_author=Félix Krawatzek;,citation_author=Daniela Mehler;,citation_author=Friedemann Pes℡;,citation_author=Rieke Trimçev;,citation_publication_date=2014;,citation_cover_date=2014;,citation_year=2014;,citation_fulltext_html_url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/hith.10693;,citation_issue=1;,citation_doi=10.1111/hith.10693;,citation_issn=1468-2303;,citation_volume=53;,citation_journal_title=History and Theory;">
<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Finding Meaning in Memory: A Methodological Critique of Collective Memory Studies;,citation_abstract=The memory wave in the humanities has contributed to the impressive revival of cultural history, but the success of memory studies has not been accompanied by significant conceptual and methodological advances in the research of collective memory processes. Most studies on memory focus on the representation of specific events within particular chronological, geographical, and media settings without reflecting on the audiences of the representations in question. As a result, the wealth of new insights into past and present historical cultures cannot be linked conclusively to specific social collectives and their historical consciousness. This methodological problem is even enhanced by the metaphorical use of psychological and neurological terminology, which misrepresents the social dynamics of collective memory as an effect and extension of individual, autobiographical memory. Some of these shortcomings can be addressed through the extensive contextualization of specific strategies of representation, which links facts of representation with facts of reception. As a result, the history of collective memory would be recast as a complex process of cultural production and consumption that acknowledges the persistence of cultural traditions as well as the ingenuity of memory makers and the subversive interests of memory consumers. The negotiations among these three different historical agents create the rules of engagement in the competitive arena of memory politics, and the reconstruction of these negotiations helps us distinguish among the abundance of failed collective memory initiatives on the one hand and the few cases of successful collective memory construction on the other. For this purpose, collective memory studies should adopt the methods of communication and media studies, especially with regard to media reception, and continue to use a wide range of interpretive tools from traditional historiography to poststructural approaches. From the perspective of collective memory studies, these two traditions are closely related and mutually beneficial, rather than mutually exclusive, ways of analyzing historical cultures.;,citation_author=Wulf Kansteiner;,citation_publication_date=2002;,citation_cover_date=2002;,citation_year=2002;,citation_fulltext_html_url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/0018-2656.00198;,citation_issue=2;,citation_doi=10.1111/0018-2656.00198;,citation_issn=1468-2303;,citation_volume=41;,citation_journal_title=History and Theory;">

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Life in the fast lane? Towards a sociology of technology and time;,citation_abstract=Assumptions about the pace of life speeding up abound in contemporary social theory. While many factors are contributing to this phenomenon, information and communication technologies are seen as the main drivers. This article considers the way social theorists analyse the concepts of time and speed and then examines how these claims might be assessed in the light of empirical research. Such research shows that time compression has multiple dimensions, and that the effect of digital devices like the mobile phone is not simply one of acceleration. In particular, I suggest that the social studies of technology offers a richer analysis of the reciprocal relationship between technological innovation and changing time practices. My argument is that while the hitherto neglected temporal dimension in sociological theory is now being addressed, there is an urgent need for increased dialogue to connect social theory with detailed empirical studies.

We explore this integration of fact and value in an unexpected setting: the “talk pages” of the online encyclopedia Wikipedia in which discussions of article creation are recorded. Our analysis of these discussions draws on Nelson Goodman’s Ways of Worldmaking, another classic on the social construction of reality, which catalogues strategies for producing a worldview. We utilize Goodman’s theories in four cases of Wikipedia article creation – two histories, “Iraq War” and “Afghanistan War,” and two biographies, “George W.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Collaboratively constructed contradictory accounts: Online organizational narratives;,citation_abstract=Based on a mixed-method case study of online communication about the Danish pharmaceutical company Novo Nordisk, this article argues that online communication plays out as a centrifugal narration process with centripetal consequences. Through a content analysis of communication about Novo Nordisk, three dominant online meaning constructions that present themselves as narratives are identified and their convergence into one overarching meta-narrative is identified. The meta-narrative of Novo Nordisk as the ruthlessly profit-seeking socially responsible heavenly work place is made up of the three interrelated, yet disparate tales about Novo Nordisk as (1) a socially responsible organization, engaged in society at large; (2) an organization primarily concerned with fulfilling its own objectives – profit maximization; and (3) a great and employee-centred workplace. The article then discusses the theoretical and methodological implications of the empirical findings. It is argued that although the findings are not in themselves surprising, they adequately reflect that online meaning formation is, indeed, a collaborative process in which centrifugal forces have centripetal consequences. Furthermore, the findings suggest that the chosen mixed-method case study successfully navigates the dilemma of studying online collaborative processes through the traces they leave behind.;,citation_author=Ib Tunby Gulbrandsen;,citation_author=Sine Nørholm Just;,citation_publication_date=2013-07;,citation_cover_date=2013-07;,citation_year=2013;,citation_fulltext_html_url=https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0163443713485492;,citation_issue=5;,citation_doi=10.1177/0163443713485492;,citation_issn=0163-4437;,citation_volume=35;,citation_journal_title=Media, Culture &amp;amp;amp; Society;">

This article aims to advance work in this context by identifying a range of issues that should spark additional reflections and discussions within communication and media studies and related fields. In particular, the article focuses on three key issues that have to do with long-standing discussions about the social and political impact of the internet: the role of web platforms in shaping information access, the relationship between production and consumption online, and the role of affect in informing engagement with web resources. Considering these issues in regard to voice assistants not only helps contextualize these technologies within existing debates in communication and media studies, but also highlights that voice assistants pose novel questions to internet research, challenging assumptions of what the web looks like as speech becomes one of the key ways to access resources and information online.;,citation_author=Simone Natale;,citation_author=Henry Cooke;,citation_publication_date=2021-09;,citation_cover_date=2021-09;,citation_year=2021;,citation_fulltext_html_url=https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0163443720983295;,citation_issue=6;,citation_doi=10.1177/0163443720983295;,citation_issn=0163-4437;,citation_volume=43;,citation_journal_title=Media, Culture &amp;amp;amp; Society;">

Designed as a single revelatory case study, with a focus on Russia, this article delineates a typology of four types of memory events based on four types of websites dominating search results. For each type of event, we discuss recurring locations and mechanisms of power struggles over competing memory narratives. We conclude that within Russia’s authoritarian context, the mnemonic practice of Internet searching tends to reproduce and reinforce the dominant narratives supported by the ruling elites. Search engine companies are thus only one of several powerful institutions that constitute the social framework within which querying the Internet is pursued as a mnemonic practice.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=The Politics of Real-time: A Device Perspective on Social Media Platforms and Search Engines;,citation_abstract=This paper enquires into the politics of real-time in online media. It suggests that real-time cannot be accounted for as a universal temporal frame in which events happen, but explores the making of real-time from a device perspective focusing on the temporalities of platforms. Based on an empirical study exploring the pace at which various online media produce new content, we trace the different rhythms, patterns or tempos created by the interplay of devices, users? web activities and issues. What emerges are distinct forms of ?realtimeness? which are not external from but specific to devices, organized through socio-technical arrangements and practices of use. Realtimeness thus unflattens more general accounts of the real-time web and research, and draws attention to the agencies built into specific platform temporalities and the political economies of making real-time.;,citation_author=Esther Weltevrede;,citation_author=Anne Helmond;,citation_author=Carolin Gerlitz;,citation_publication_date=2014-11;,citation_cover_date=2014-11;,citation_year=2014;,citation_fulltext_html_url=https://doi.org/10.1177/0263276414537318;,citation_issue=6;,citation_doi=10.1177/0263276414537318;,citation_issn=0263-2764;,citation_volume=31;,citation_journal_title=Theory, Culture &amp;amp;amp; Society;">
<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Summa Technologiae;,citation_abstract=The Polish writer Stanislaw Lem is best known to English-speaking readers as the author of the 1961 science fiction novel Solaris, adapted into a meditative film by Andrei Tarkovsky in 1972 and remade in 2002 by Steven Soderbergh. Throughout his writings, comprising dozens of science fiction novels and short stories, Lem offered deeply philosophical and bitingly satirical reflections on the limitations of both science and humanity. In Summa Technologiae–his major work of nonfiction, first published in 1964 and now available in English for the first time–Lem produced an engaging and caustically logical philosophical treatise about human and nonhuman life in its past, present, and future forms. After five decades Summa Technologiae has lost none of its intellectual or critical significance. Indeed, many of Lem’s conjectures about future technologies have now come true: from artificial intelligence, bionics, and nanotechnology to the dangers of information overload, the concept underlying Internet search engines, and the idea of virtual reality. More important for its continued relevance, however, is Lem’s rigorous investigation into the parallel development of biological and technical evolution and his conclusion that technology will outlive humanity. Preceding Richard Dawkins’s understanding of evolution as a blind watchmaker by more than two decades, Lem posits evolution as opportunistic, shortsighted, extravagant, and illogical. Strikingly original and still timely, Summa Technologiae resonates with a wide range of contemporary debates about information and new media, the life sciences, and the emerging relationship between technology and humanity.;,citation_author=Stanisław Lem;,citation_author=Joanna Zylinska;,citation_publication_date=2013;,citation_cover_date=2013;,citation_year=2013;,citation_fulltext_html_url=http://ebookcentral.proquest.com/lib/uts/detail.action?docID=1204686;,citation_isbn=978-0-8166-8903-3;">

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=It’s about time: Temporal structuring in organizations;,citation_abstract=This paper proposes the notion of temporal structuring as a way of understanding and studying time as an enacted phenomenon within organizations. It suggests that through their everyday action, actors produce and reproduce a variety of temporal structures which in turn shape the temporal rhythm and form of their ongoing practices. A focus on temporal structuring, combined with a practice perspective, allows the subjective-objective dichotomy that underlies much of the existing research on time in organizations to be bridged. After developing the notion of temporal structuring, the paper illustrates its use in the context of prior empirical study. The paper concludes by outlining some implications of temporal structuring for organizational research on time.;,citation_author=Wanda J.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Rethinking time’s arrow: Bergson, Deleuze and the anthropology of time;,citation_abstract=Since the early 1970s, time has come to the fore as a constitutive element of social analysis in the guise of what I term here ’fluid time’. Anthropologists of multiple theoretical persuasions now take for granted that social life exists in ’time’, ’flow’, or ’flux’, and this temporal ontology is commonly accepted as a universal, if habitually unquestioned, attribute of human experience. Similarly, it underpins today’s dominant paradigm of ’processual’ analysis, in its many forms. Yet this concept is notably under-theorized, in keeping with a history of uneven study by social scientists of time. In this article I draw on anthropological approaches by Gell and Munn, and philosophical work by Bergson and Deleuze, to put forward a critical theorization. I then discuss its ramifications. Ultimately, I argue that this model points to a rapprochement between the anthropological study of time and history, sociality and temporality, and an enhanced role for temporal analysis in anthropological theory.;,citation_author=Matt Hodges;,citation_publication_date=2008-12;,citation_cover_date=2008-12;,citation_year=2008;,citation_fulltext_html_url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1463499608096646;,citation_issue=4;,citation_doi=10.1177/1463499608096646;,citation_issn=1463-4996, 1741-2641;,citation_volume=8;,citation_journal_title=Anthropological Theory;">

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=The Past and the Present in the Present;,citation_abstract=This lecture starts by considering the old problem of how to account for social change theoretically and criticises some of the models used because, either they see the social process in terms used by the actors and so are unable to explain how it is that actors can change those terms, or they see the mechanisms of change as occurring in terms totally alien to the actors and so are unable to explain how these mechanisms can be transformed into meaningful action. The source of this problem is traced to Durkheim’s notion that cognition is socially determined. By contrast it is argued that those concepts which are moulded to social structure are not typical of knowledge but only found in ritual discourse, while the concepts using non-ritual discourse are constrained by such factors as the requirements of human action on nature. This means that there are terms available to actors by which the social order can be criticised since not all terms are moulded by it. Finally it is suggested that such notions as social structure only refer to ritualized folk statements about society, statements expressed in ritual discourse precisely with those concepts which are given as demonstrations of the theory of the cultural relativity of cognition. The Durkheimian correlation between society and cognition is merely a correlation of only certain ethical statements and certain aspects of cognition. This type of discourse is present in different types of society in varying amounts according to the degree of instituted hierarchy that these societies manifest. Anthropological theories about the conceptualisation of time are given as an example of the general argument.;,citation_author=Maurice Bloch;,citation_publication_date=1977;,citation_cover_date=1977;,citation_year=1977;,citation_fulltext_html_url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/2800799;,citation_issue=2;,citation_doi=10.2307/2800799;,citation_issn=0025-1496;,citation_volume=12;,citation_journal_title=Man;">

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Resonance: A sociology of the relationship to the world;,citation_abstract=Summary: The pace of modern life is undoubtedly speeding up, yet this acceleration does not seem to have made us any happier or more content. If acceleration is the problem, then the solution, argues Hartmut Rosa in this major new work, lies in &amp;amp;amp;quot;resonance.&amp;quot; The quality of a human life cannot be measured simply in terms of resources, options, and moments of happiness; instead, we must consider our relationship to, or resonance with, the world. Applying his theory of resonance to many domains of human activity, Rosa describes the full spectrum of ways in which we establish our relationship to the world, from the act of breathing to the adoption of culturally distinct worldviews. He then turns to the realms of concrete experience and action - family and politics, work and sports, religion and art - in which we as late modern subjects seek out resonance. This task is proving ever more difficult as modernity’s logic of escalation is both cause and consequence of a distorted relationship to the world, at individual and collective levels. As Rosa shows, all the great crises of modern society - the environmental crisis, the crisis of democracy, the psychological crisis - can also be understood and analyzed in terms of resonance and our broken relationship to the world around us. Building on his now classic work on acceleration, Rosa’s new book is a major new contribution to the theory of modernity, showing how our problematic relation to the world is at the crux of some of the most pressing issues we face today. This bold renewal of critical theory for our times will be of great interest to students and scholars across the social sciences and humanities.;,citation_author=Hartmut Rosa;,citation_publication_date=2019;,citation_cover_date=2019;,citation_year=2019;,citation_isbn=978-1-5095-1989-7;">
<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=The politics of memory : An extended case study of the memory of crisis on Wikipedia;,citation_abstract=Numerous studies of memory on Wikipedia focus on edit wars (conflict between editors) relating to memories of war, atrocities and protests. There has been limited investigation of how other forms of social crisis are (re)constructed - including with regard to the interests, and involvement, of those groups more likely to be at risk of negative outcomes from crises. Processes of social and transitional justice (following crises) should include and empower these groups. Recent research on disaster risk reduction also suggests that memory (re)constructions contribute to preparation for future disasters, and it is important that the social choices interacting with disasters are considered as part of this. There is, however, limited evidence of how such issues are recognised and addressed in the (re)construction of diverse crises on Wikipedia - which feed into systems of automated forms of knowledge-making on the web. To address the above, an extended case study is developed on the (re)construction of a major pollution event (the Great Smog of London). Critical discourse analysis of intertextuality (connections between texts through hyperlinking and other shared patterning) is utilised to move from a focus on micro level practices to macro and meta level findings on the ordering of Wikipedia and its interactions with other institutions. Findings evidence a layered, self-referencing formation across texts, favouring the interests of established institutions and providing limited opportunity for marginalised groups to interact with sustained (re)constructions of the Great Smog. Comparison to a previous study of the constructed memory of a crisis (the London Bombings 2005) reveals dynamics across Wikipedia that lead to an emphasis on connecting (re)constructions to institutional traditions rather than the potential usefulness of such (re)construction for those at higher risk of negative outcomes arising from repeated crises.;,citation_author=Nina Margaret Schuller;,citation_publication_date=2023;,citation_cover_date=2023;,citation_year=2023;,citation_fulltext_html_url=https://eprints.soton.ac.uk/475212/;,citation_dissertation_institution=University of Southampton;">

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=The Queer Art of Failure;,citation_abstract=The Queer Art of Failure is about finding alternatives-to conventional understandings of success in a heteronormative, capitalist society; to academic disciplines that confirm what is already known according to approved methods of knowing; and to cultural criticism that claims to break new ground but cleaves to conventional archives. Judith Halberstam proposes &amp;amp;amp;quot;low theory&amp;quot; as a mode of thinking and writing that operates at many different levels at once. Low theory is derived from eccentric archives. It runs the risk of not being taken seriously. It entails a willingness to fail and to lose one’s way, to pursue difficult questions about complicity, and to find counterintuitive forms of resistance. Tacking back and forth between high theory and low theory, high culture and low culture, Halberstam looks for the unexpected and subversive in popular culture, avant-garde performance, and queer art. She pays particular attention to animated children’s films, revealing narratives filled with unexpected encounters between the childish, the transformative, and the queer. Failure sometimes offers more creative, cooperative, and surprising ways of being in the world, even as it forces us to face the dark side of life, love, and libido.;,citation_author=Judith Halberstam;,citation_publication_date=2011;,citation_cover_date=2011;,citation_year=2011;,citation_fulltext_html_url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctv11sn283;,citation_doi=10.2307/j.ctv11sn283;,citation_isbn=978-0-8223-5028-6;">
<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Research Is Ceremony: Indigenous Research Methods;,citation_abstract=Indigenous researchers are knowledge seekers who work to progress Indigenous ways of being, knowing and doing in a modern and constantly evolving context. This book describes a research paradigm shared by Indigenous scholars in Canada and Australia, and demonstrates how this paradigm can be put into practice. Relationships don’t just shape Indigenous reality, they are our reality. Indigenous researchers develop relationships with ideas in order to achieve enlightenment in the ceremony that is Indigenous research. Indigenous research is the ceremony of maintaining accountability to these relationships. For researchers to be accountable to all our relations, we must make careful choices in our selection of topics, methods of data collection, forms of analysis and finally in the way we present information.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Autobiographical forgetting, social forgetting, and situated forgetting *: Forgetting in context;,citation_abstract=This chapter focuses on autobiographical memory, which relates to events and experiences in our personal past. Autobiographical memories are our recollections of specific episodes from the past. Research within different traditions and paradigms supports the view that certain kinds of memories are forgotten in apparently goal-directed ways. For instance, diary studies have suggested that whereas people are more likely to forget events about themselves that are negative rather than positive, they are more likely to forget events about others that are positive rather than negative. The retrieval-induced forgetting (RIF) paradigm developed by Anderson, Bjork, and Bjork models the kind of forgetting that occurs unconsciously in response to competition between memories, by practising some memories at the expense of others. RIF is considered an automatic, inevitable consequence of practising one piece of information at the expense of another.;,citation_author=Celia B.

Using the corpus of 6,132 articles about people who died in 2012, we examine the network relationships and contribution dynamics of users who perform this work and identify behavioral and content dynamics on the biographical articles about the deceased. The collaborations that emerge from posthumous editing of these biographies are sites of significant activity that coalesce into complex but temporary collaborations. Based on these findings, we argue that Wikipedia has re-imagined the obituary into a genre for creating memory spaces in which the death of a subject prompts a form of &quot;death work&quot; involving the collective re-evaluation of article content and a transition into a new mode of data stewardship.;,citation_author=Brian C.

While prior research in archival studies and demographics has examined processes of collecting and storing queer identities, they do not examine the complexities of highly democratized platforms that lack top-down mandates that often structure archival schemas. To examine the representation of queer people on open-platform databases, we performed a trace ethnography and thematic analysis of Wikidata, an open collaboration, highly structured database. We specifically examined the creation of, changes to, discussions around, and impacts of properties that encode queer identities, such assexual orientation andsex or gender. We found that changes often have unexpected impacts, that contributors struggled to determine vocabulary for queer identities which were accurate across the diverse cultural contexts of the Wikidata community, that the recording of queer identities could cause a stigmatizing effect for LGBTQ+ individuals, with further concerns of spreading rumors or outing closeted people, and that contributors proposing changes which would cause biased representations of queer people. Our analysis demonstrates inherent and unaddressed frictions when translating queer identities to the confines of a structured database. We conclude by discussing ways that the highly bottom-up, collaborative nature of platforms such as Wikidata, often seen as a major strength, can be vulnerable to individuals or small groups derailing and filibustering changes they disagree with on politically charged topics such as queer identities.;,citation_author=Katy Weathington;,citation_author=Jed R.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Business network becoming: Figurations of time, change and process;,citation_abstract=Concepts such as “time” and “change” are always presaged by metaphor, narratives and other “tropes” and are therefore, representations invented by association, analogy, indirect inferences and figuration. If these representations change, then their meaning also changes. In this paper, we argue that dominant figurations of time have been predominantly mechanistic and a consequence of “substance” metaphysics. The mechanistic metaphor of time constructs comprehensions of time that are linear, homogenous and clock-like. As with any analogical representations, this type of figuration favors some aspects of time and diminishes others. Our proposition is that if we apply an alternative “process metaphysics” to time, then this is associated with different figurative representations. In this paper, we make specific reference to the IMP research tradition where we explore “holographic or rhizomic time” as a different temporal metaphor. We illustrate what linear clock time reveals and hides in a “centered” epistemology and explore what an adoption of “holographic” time would allow us to see, and discuss some of the benefits and limitations of this different figuration of time, which promotes a “de-centered” epistemology.;,citation_author=Sid Lowe;,citation_author=Michel Rod;,citation_publication_date=2018-01;,citation_cover_date=2018-01;,citation_year=2018;,citation_fulltext_html_url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0019850117307915;,citation_doi=10.1016/j.indmarman.2017.10.012;,citation_issn=0019-8501;,citation_volume=68;,citation_journal_title=Industrial Marketing Management;">

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Infoboxes and cleanup tags: Artifacts of Wikipedia newsmaking;,citation_abstract=Wikipedians use a number of editorial elements, including infoboxes and cleanup tags to coordinate work in the first stage of articles related to breaking news topics. When inserted into an article, these objects are intended to simultaneously notify editors about missing or weak elements of the article and to add articles to particular categories of work. This categorization practice enables editors to collaborate iteratively with one another because each object signals work that needs to be done by others in order to fill in the gaps of the current content. In addition to this functional value, however, categorization also has a number of symbolic and political consequences. Editors are engaged in a continual practice of iterative summation that contributes to an active construction of the event as it happens rather than a mere assembling of “reliable sources”. The deployment and removal of cleanup tags can be seen as an act of power play between editors that affects readers’ evaluation of the article’s content. Infoboxes are similar sites of struggle whose deployment and development result in an erasure of the contradictions and debates that gave rise to them. These objects illuminate how this novel journalistic practice has important implications for the way that political events are represented.;,citation_author=Heather Ford;,citation_publication_date=2015-01;,citation_cover_date=2015-01;,citation_year=2015;,citation_fulltext_html_url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1464884914545739;,citation_issue=1;,citation_doi=10.1177/1464884914545739;,citation_issn=1464-8849, 1741-3001;,citation_volume=16;,citation_journal_title=Journalism;">
<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Wikipedia’s Race and Ethnicity Gap and the Unverifiability of Whiteness;,citation_abstract=Although Wikipedia has a widely studied gender gap, almost no research has attempted to discover if it has a comparable race and ethnicity gap among its editors or its articles. No such comprehensive analysis of Wikipedia’s editors exists because legal, cultural, and social structures complicate surveying them about race and ethnicity. Nor is it possible to precisely measure how many of Wikipedia’s biographies are about people from indigenous and nondominant ethnic groups, because most articles lack ethnicity information. While it seems that many of these uncategorized biographies are about white people, these biographies are not categorized by ethnicity because policies require reliable sources to do so. These sources do not exist for white people because whiteness is a social construct that has historically been treated as a transparent default. Thus, these biographies cannot be categorized as white because whiteness is unverifiable in Wikipedia’s white epistemology. In the absence of a precise analysis of the gaps in its editors or its articles, I present a quantitative and qualitative analysis of these structures that prevent such an analysis. I examine policy discussions about categorization by race and ethnicity, demonstrating persistent anti-Black racism. Turning to Wikidata, I reveal how the ontology of whiteness shifts as it enters the database, functioning differently than existing theories of whiteness account for. While the data does point toward a significant race and ethnicity gap, the data cannot definitively reveal meaning beyond its inability to reveal quantitative meaning. Yet the unverifiability of whiteness is itself an undeniable verification of Wikipedia’s whiteness.;,citation_author=Michael Mandiberg;,citation_publication_date=2023-03;,citation_cover_date=2023-03;,citation_year=2023;,citation_fulltext_html_url=https://doi.org/10.1215/01642472-10174954;,citation_issue=1 (154);,citation_doi=10.1215/01642472-10174954;,citation_issn=0164-2472;,citation_volume=41;,citation_journal_title=Social Text;">

An Exploration of Wikidata Contributors’ Motivations;,citation_abstract=Structured data peer production (SDPP) platforms like Wikidata play an important role in knowledge production. Compared to traditional peer production platforms like Wikipedia, Wikidata data is more structured and intended to be used by machines, not (directly) by people; end-user interactions with Wikidata often happen through intermediary &amp;amp;amp;quot;invisible machines.&amp;quot; Given this distinction, we wanted to understand Wikidata contributor motivations and how they are affected by usage invisibility caused by the machine intermediaries. Through an inductive thematic analysis of 15 interviews, we find that: (i) Wikidata editors take on two archetypes—Architects who define the ontological infrastructure of Wikidata, and Masons who build the database through data entry and editing; (ii) the structured nature of Wikidata reveals novel editor motivations, such as an innate drive for organizational work; (iii) most Wikidata editors have little understanding of how their contributions are used, which may demotivate some.

But what does this term refer to? How is “real-time” made, managed and experienced? This article explores these questions, drawing on interviews with UK-based digital media professionals. Its specific concern is with how accounts of the time of digital media indicate a particular, yet supple, temporality, which emphasises “the now”. I draw on current literature that explores how real-time is a temporality capable of being stretched and condensed, or variously compressed and paced. While much of this literature focuses on the technological fabrication of real-time, I explore how “the now” is produced through the interplay between human and non-human practices. Through discussion of the interviews, the article concentrates on social, cultural and affective dimensions of “the now”, fleshing out more technologically focused work and contributing to understanding of a prevalent way in which time is organised in contemporary digital societies.;,citation_author=Rebecca Coleman;,citation_publication_date=2020-09;,citation_cover_date=2020-09;,citation_year=2020;,citation_fulltext_html_url=https://doi.org/10.1177/1461444820914871;,citation_issue=9;,citation_doi=10.1177/1461444820914871;,citation_issn=1461-4448;,citation_volume=22;,citation_journal_title=New Media &amp;amp;amp; Society;">
<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Digital Timescapes: Technology, Temporality and Society;,citation_abstract=Digital technologies are having a profound effect on the temporalities of individuals, households and organisations. We now expect to be able to instantly source a vast array of information at any time and from anywhere, as well as buy goods with the click of a button and have them delivered within hours, while time management apps and locative media have altered how everyday scheduling and mobility unfolds. Digital Timescapes makes the case that we have transitioned to an era where the production and experience of time is qualitatively different to the pre-digital era. Rob Kitchin provides a synoptic account of this transition, charting how digital technologies, in a wide range of manifestations, are reconfiguring everyday temporalities. Attention is focused on the temporalities associated with six sets of everyday practices: history and memory; politics and policy; governance and governmentality; mobility and logistics; planning and development; and work and labour. Critically, how to challenge and reorder digitally mediated temporal power is examined through the development of an ethics of temporal care and temporal justice. Conceptually and empirically rich, Digital Timescapes is an essential guide to our new temporal regime. It will be of interest to students and scholars of Media Studies, Science and Technology Studies, Sociology, Anthropology, Human Geography, and History and Memory Studies, as well as those who are interested in how digital technologies are transforming society.;,citation_author=Rob Kitchin;,citation_publication_date=2023;,citation_cover_date=2023;,citation_year=2023;,citation_fulltext_html_url=http://ebookcentral.proquest.com/lib/uts/detail.action?docID=7187252;,citation_isbn=978-1-5095-5685-4;">

Focusing on articles about geographic entities (e.g. cities, points of interest) in 79 language editions of Wikipedia, we examine the localness of both the editors working on articles and the sources of the information they cite. We find extensive geographic inequalities in localness, with the degree of localness varying with the socioeconomic status of the local population and the health of the local media. We also point out the key role of language, showing that information in languages not native to a place tends to be produced and sourced by non-locals. We discuss the implications of this work for our understanding of the nature of VGI and highlight a generalizable technical contribution: an algorithm that determines the home country of the original publisher of online content.;,citation_author=Shilad W.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=The Condition of Digitality: A Post-Modern Marxism for the Practice of Digital Life;,citation_abstract=David Harvey’s The Condition of Postmodernity rationalised capitalism’s transformation during an extraordinary year: 1989. It gave theoretical expression to a material and cultural reality that was just then getting properly started – globalisation and postmodernity – whilst highlighting the geo-spatial limits to accumulation imposed by our planet. However this landmark publication, author Robert Hassan argues, did not address the arrival of digital technology, the quantum leap represented by the move from an analogue world to a digital economy and the rapid creation of a global networked society. Considering first the contexts of 1989 and Harvey’s work, then the idea of humans as analogue beings he argues this arising new human condition of digitality leads to alienation not only from technology but also the environment. This condition he suggests, is not an ideology of time and space but a reality stressing that Harvey’s time-space compression takes on new features including those of “outward” and “inward” globalisation and the commodification of all spheres of existence. Lastly the author considers culture’s role drawing on Rahel Jaeggi’s theories to make the case for a post-modern Marxism attuned to the most significant issue of our age. Stimulating and theoretically wide-ranging The Condition of Digitality recognises post-modernity’s radical new form as a reality and the urgent need to assert more democratic control over digitality.;,citation_author=Robert Hassan;,citation_publication_date=2020;,citation_cover_date=2020;,citation_year=2020;,citation_fulltext_html_url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctvw1d5k0;,citation_isbn=978-1-912656-67-7;">

Computers have changed the human social experience enormously. We’re becoming familiar with many of the macro changes, but we rarely consider the complex, underlying mechanics of how a technology interacts with our social, political and economic worlds. And we cannot explain how the mechanics of a technology are being translated into social influence unless we understand the role of time in that process. Offering an original reconsideration of temporality, Philip Pond explains how super-powerful computers and global webs of connection have remade time through speed.

Scholarship on Wikipedia’s Political Economy;,citation_abstract=Wikipedia, the world’s largest encyclopedia and the Internet’s fifth most visited website, has been the focus of much research over the past decade, much of which uses big data or case studies to investigate issues of content quality and trends in the contributor base. A smaller number of researchers and theorists have explored the site and what it means for digital communication from a theoretical perspective, and in particular, from the lens of political economy[cM1][cM2]. Through reviewing some of the major scholarly work on the political economy of Wikipedia, this paper examines the major tensions that emerge from critical analysis of the project. Two major threads emerge in this literature – materiality/immateriality and ideologies that challenge capitalism – that help us understand Wikipedia’s place in the digital milieu and point to areas were new critical theoretical work is necessary.;,citation_author=Randall Livingstone;,citation_publication_date=2019;,citation_cover_date=2019;,citation_year=2019;,citation_isbn=978-0-429-46933-6;,citation_inbook_title=Political Economy of Media Industries;">
<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Let’s Leave the Bias to the Mainstream Media: A Wikipedia Community Fighting for Information Neutrality;,citation_abstract=Although I’m a rich white guy, I’m also a feminist anti-racism activist who fights for the rights of the poor and oppressed. (Carl Kenner)Systemic bias is a scourge to the pillar of neutrality. (Cerejota)Count me in. Let’s leave the bias to the mainstream media. (Orcar967)Because this is so important. (CuttingEdge)These are a handful of comments posted by online editors who have banded together in a virtual coalition to combat Western bias on the world’s largest digital encyclopedia, Wikipedia. This collective action by Wikipedians both acknowledges the inherent inequalities of a user-controlled information project like Wikpedia and highlights the potential for progressive change within that same project. These community members are taking the responsibility of social change into their own hands (or more aptly, their own keyboards).In recent years much research has emerged on Wikipedia from varying fields, ranging from computer science, to business and information systems, to the social sciences. While critical at times of Wikipedia’s growth, governance, and influence, most of this work observes with optimism that barriers to improvement are not firmly structural, but rather they are socially constructed, leaving open the possibility of important and lasting change for the better.WikiProject: Countering Systemic Bias (WP:CSB) considers one such collective effort. Close to 350 editors have signed on to the project, which began in 2004 and itself emerged from a similar project named CROSSBOW, or the “Committee Regarding Overcoming Serious Systemic Bias on Wikipedia.” As a WikiProject, the term used for a loose group of editors who collaborate around a particular topic, these editors work within the Wikipedia site and collectively create a social network that is unified around one central aim—representing the un- and underrepresented—and yet they are bound by no particular unified set of interests.&nbsp;The first stage of a multi-method study, this paper looks at a snapshot of WP:CSB’s activity from both content analysis and social network perspectives to discover “who” geographically this coalition of the unrepresented is inserting into the digital annals of Wikipedia.Wikipedia and WikipediansDeveloped in 2001 by Internet entrepreneur Jimmy Wales and academic Larry Sanger, Wikipedia is an online collaborative encyclopedia hosting articles in nearly 250 languages (Cohen). The English-language Wikipedia contains over 3.2 million articles, each of which is created, edited, and updated solely by users (Wikipedia “Welcome”). At the time of this study, Alexa, a website tracking organisation, ranked Wikipedia as the 6th most accessed site on the Internet. Unlike the five sites ahead of it though—Google, Facebook, Yahoo, YouTube (owned by Google), and live.com (owned by Microsoft)—all of which are multibillion-dollar businesses that deal more with information aggregation than information production, Wikipedia is a non-profit that operates on less than $500,000 a year and staffs only a dozen paid employees (Lih). Wikipedia is financed and supported by the WikiMedia Foundation, a charitable umbrella organisation with an annual budget of $4.6 million, mainly funded by donations (Middleton).Wikipedia editors and contributors have the option of creating a user profile and participating via a username, or they may participate anonymously, with only an IP address representing their actions. Despite the option for total anonymity, many Wikipedians have chosen to visibly engage in this online community (Ayers, Matthews, and Yates; Bruns; Lih), and researchers across disciplines are studying the motivations of these new online collectives (Kane, Majchrzak, Johnson, and Chenisern; Oreg and Nov). The motivations of open source software contributors, such as UNIX programmers and programming groups, have been shown to be complex and tied to both extrinsic and intrinsic rewards, including online reputation, self-satisfaction and enjoyment, and obligation to a greater common good (Hertel, Niedner, and Herrmann; Osterloh and Rota). Investigation into why Wikipedians edit has indicated multiple motivations as well, with community engagement, task enjoyment, and information sharing among the most significant (Schroer and Hertel). Additionally, Wikipedians seem to be taking up the cause of generativity (a concern for the ongoing health and openness of the Internet’s infrastructures) that Jonathan Zittrain notably called for in The Future of the Internet and How to Stop It.&nbsp;Governance and ControlAlthough the technical infrastructure of Wikipedia is built to support and perhaps encourage an equal distribution of power on the site, Wikipedia is not a land of “anything goes.” The popular press has covered recent efforts by the site to reduce vandalism through a layer of editorial review (Cohen), a tightening of control cited as a possible reason for the recent dip in the number of active editors (Edwards). A number of regulations are already in place that prevent the open editing of certain articles and pages, such as the site’s&nbsp;disclaimers and pages that have suffered large amounts of vandalism. Editing wars can also cause temporary restrictions to editing, and Ayers, Matthews, and Yates point out that these wars can happen anywhere, even to Burt Reynold’s&nbsp;page.Academic studies have begun to explore the governance and control that has developed in the Wikipedia community, generally highlighting how order is maintained not through particular actors, but through established procedures and norms. Konieczny tested whether Wikipedia’s evolution can be defined by Michels’ Iron Law of Oligopoly, which predicts that the everyday operations of any organisation cannot be run by a mass of members, and ultimately control falls into the hands of the few. Through exploring a particular WikiProject on information validation, he concludes:There are few indicators of an oligarchy having power on Wikipedia, and few trends of a change in this situation.&nbsp;The high level of empowerment of individual Wikipedia editors with regard to policy making, the ease of communication, and the high dedication to ideals of contributors succeed in making Wikipedia an atypical organization, quite resilient to the Iron Law. (189)Butler, Joyce, and Pike support this assertion, though they emphasise that instead of oligarchy, control becomes encapsulated in a wide variety of structures, policies, and procedures that guide involvement with the site. A virtual “bureaucracy” emerges, but one that should not be viewed with the negative connotation often associated with the term.Other work considers control on Wikipedia through the framework of commons governance, where “peer production depends on individual action that is self-selected and decentralized rather than hierarchically assigned. Individuals make their own choices with regard to resources managed as a commons” (Viegas, Wattenberg and McKeon). The need for quality standards and quality control largely dictate this commons governance, though interviewing Wikipedians with various levels of responsibility revealed that policies and procedures are only as good as those who maintain them. Forte, Larco, and Bruckman argue “the Wikipedia community has remained healthy in large part due to the continued presence of ‘old-timers’ who carry a set of social norms and organizational ideals with them into every WikiProject, committee, and local process in which they take part” (71). Thus governance on Wikipedia is a strong representation of a democratic ideal, where actors and policies are closely tied in their evolution. Transparency, Content, and BiasThe issue of transparency has proved to be a double-edged sword for Wikipedia and Wikipedians. The goal of a collective body of knowledge created by all—the “expert” and the “amateur”—can only be upheld if equal access to page creation and development is allotted to everyone, including those who prefer anonymity. And yet this very option for anonymity, or even worse, false identities, has been a sore subject for some in the Wikipedia community as well as a source of concern for some scholars (Santana and Wood). The case of a 24-year old college dropout who represented himself as a multiple Ph.D.-holding theology scholar and edited over 16,000 articles brought these issues into the public spotlight in 2007 (Doran; Elsworth). Wikipedia itself has set up standards for content that include expectations of a neutral point of view, verifiability of information, and the publishing of no original research, but Santana and Wood argue that self-policing of these policies is not adequate:The principle of managerial discretion requires that every actor act from a sense of duty to exercise moral autonomy and choice in responsible ways.&nbsp; When Wikipedia’s editors and administrators remain anonymous, this criterion is simply not met.&nbsp; It is assumed that everyone is behaving responsibly within the Wikipedia system, but there are no monitoring or control mechanisms to make sure that this is so, and there is ample evidence that it is not so. (141) At the theoretical level, some downplay these concerns of transparency and autonomy as logistical issues in lieu of the potential for information systems to support rational discourse and emancipatory forms of communication (Hansen, Berente, and Lyytinen), but others worry that the questionable “realities” created on Wikipedia will become truths once circulated to all areas of the Web (Langlois and Elmer).&nbsp; With the number of articles on the English-language version of Wikipedia reaching well into the millions, the task of mapping and assessing content has become a tremendous endeavour, one mostly taken on by information systems experts. Kittur, Chi, and Suh have used Wikipedia’s existing hierarchical categorisation structure to map change in the site’s content over the past few years. Their work revealed that in early 2008 “Culture and the arts” was the most dominant category of content on Wikipedia, representing nearly 30% of total content. People (15%) and geographical locations (14%) represent the next largest categories, while the natural and physical sciences showed the greatest increase in volume between 2006 and 2008 (+213%D, with “Culture and the arts” close behind at +210%D).&nbsp;This data may indicate that contributing to Wikipedia, and thus spreading knowledge, is growing amongst the academic community while maintaining its importance to the greater popular culture-minded community. Further work by Kittur and Kraut has explored the collaborative process of content creation, finding that too many editors on a particular page can reduce the quality of content, even when a project is well coordinated.Bias in Wikipedia content is a generally acknowledged and somewhat conflicted subject (Giles; Johnson; McHenry). The Wikipedia community has created numerous articles and pages within the site to define and discuss the problem. Citing a survey conducted by the University of Würzburg, Germany, the “Wikipedia:Systemic bias” page describes the average Wikipedian as:MaleTechnically inclinedFormally educatedAn English speakerWhiteAged 15-49From a majority Christian countryFrom a developed nationFrom the Northern HemisphereLikely a white-collar worker or studentBias in content is thought to be perpetuated by this demographic of contributor, and the “founder effect,” a concept from genetics, linking the original contributors to this same demographic has been used to explain the origins of certain biases. Wikipedia’s “About” page discusses the issue as well, in the context of the open platform’s strengths and weaknesses:in practice editing will be performed by a certain demographic (younger rather than older, male rather than female, rich enough to afford a computer rather than poor, etc.) and may, therefore, show some bias.&nbsp; Some topics may not be covered well, while others may be covered in great depth. No educated arguments against this inherent bias have been advanced.Royal and Kapila’s study of Wikipedia content tested some of these assertions, finding identifiable bias in both their purposive and random sampling. They conclude that bias favoring larger countries is positively correlated with the size of the country’s Internet population, and corporations with larger revenues work in much the same way, garnering more coverage on the site. The researchers remind us that Wikipedia is “more a socially produced document than a value-free information source” (Royal &amp;amp;amp; Kapila).WikiProject: Countering Systemic BiasAs a coalition of current Wikipedia editors, the WikiProject: Countering Systemic Bias (WP:CSB) attempts to counter trends in content production and points of view deemed harmful to the democratic ideals of a valueless, open online encyclopedia. WP:CBS’s mission is not one of policing the site, but rather deepening it:Generally, this project concentrates upon remedying omissions (entire topics, or particular sub-topics in extant articles) rather than on either (1) protesting inappropriate inclusions, or (2) trying to remedy issues of how material is presented. Thus, the first question is &amp;quot;What haven’t we covered yet?&amp;quot;, rather than &quot;how should we change the existing coverage?&quot; (Wikipedia, “Countering”)The project lays out a number of content areas lacking adequate representation, geographically highlighting the dearth in coverage of Africa, Latin America, Asia, and parts of Eastern Europe. WP:CSB also includes a “members” page that editors can sign to show their support, along with space to voice their opinions on the problem of bias on Wikipedia (the quotations at the beginning of this paper are taken from this “members” page). At the time of this study, 329 editors had self-selected and self-identified as members of WP:CSB, and this group constitutes the population sample for the current study. To explore the extent to which WP:CSB addressed these self-identified areas for improvement, each editor’s last 50 edits were coded for their primary geographical country of interest, as well as the conceptual category of the page itself (“P” for person/people, “L” for location, “I” for idea/concept, “T” for object/thing, or “NA” for indeterminate). For example, edits to the Wikipedia page for a single person like&nbsp;Tony Abbott (Australian federal opposition leader) were coded “Australia, P”, while an edit for a group of people like the&nbsp;Manchester United football team would be coded “England, P”. Coding was based on information obtained from the header paragraphs of each article’s Wikipedia page. After coding was completed, corresponding information on each country’s associated continent was added to the dataset, based on the United Nations Statistics Division listing.A total of 15,616 edits were coded for the study. Nearly 32% (n = 4962) of these edits were on articles for persons or people (see Table 1 for complete coding results). From within this sub-sample of edits, a majority of the people (68.67%) represented are associated with North America and Europe (Figure A). If we break these statistics down further, nearly half of WP:CSB’s edits concerning people were associated with the United States (36.11%) and England (10.16%), with India (3.65%) and Australia (3.35%) following at a distance. These figures make sense for the English-language Wikipedia; over 95% of the population in the three Westernised countries speak English, and while India is still often regarded as a developing nation, its colonial British roots and the emergence of a market economy with large, technology-driven cities are logical explanations for its representation here (and some&nbsp;estimates make India the largest English-speaking nation by population on the globe today).Table A &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coding Results&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Total Edits &nbsp;15616 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(I) Ideas &nbsp;2881 &nbsp;18.45% &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(L) Location &nbsp;2240 &nbsp;14.34% &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NA &nbsp;333 &nbsp;2.13% &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(T) Thing &nbsp;5200 &nbsp;33.30% &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(P) People &nbsp;4962 &nbsp;31.78% &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People by Continent&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Africa &nbsp;315 &nbsp;6.35% &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asia &nbsp;827 &nbsp;16.67% &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Australia &nbsp;175 &nbsp;3.53% &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Europe &nbsp;1411 &nbsp;28.44% &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NA &nbsp;110 &nbsp;2.22% &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;North America &nbsp;1996 &nbsp;40.23% &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;South America &nbsp;128 &nbsp;2.58% &nbsp;&nbsp;The areas of the globe of main concern to WP:CSB proved to be much less represented by the coalition itself. Asia, far and away the most populous continent with more than 60% of the globe’s people (GeoHive), was represented in only 16.67% of edits. Africa (6.35%) and South America (2.58%) were equally underrepresented compared to both their real-world populations (15% and 9% of the globe’s population respectively) and the aforementioned dominance of the advanced Westernised areas. However, while these percentages may seem low, in aggregate they do meet the quota set on the WP:CSB&nbsp;Project Page calling for one out of every twenty edits to be “a subject that is systematically biased against the pages of your natural interests.” By this standard, the coalition is indeed making headway in adding content that strategically counterbalances the natural biases of Wikipedia’s average editor.Figure ASocial network analysis allows us to visualise multifaceted data in order to identify relationships between actors and content (Vego-Redondo; Watts). Similar to Davis’s well-known sociological study of Southern American socialites in the 1930s (Scott), our Wikipedia coalition can be conceptualised as individual actors united by common interests, and a network of relations can be constructed with software such as UCINET. A mapping algorithm that considers both the relationship between all sets of actors and each actor to the overall collective structure produces an image of our network. This initial network is bimodal, as both our Wikipedia editors and their edits (again, coded for country of interest) are displayed as nodes (Figure B). Edge-lines between nodes represents a relationship, and here that relationship is the act of editing a Wikipedia article. We see from our network that the “U.S.” and “England” hold central positions in the network, with a mass of editors crowding around them. A perimeter of nations is then held in place by their ties to editors through the U.S. and England, with a second layer of editors and poorly represented nations (Gabon, Laos, Uzbekistan, etc.) around the boundaries of the network.Figure BWe are reminded from this visualisation both of the centrality of the two Western powers even among WP:CSB editoss, and of the peripheral nature of most other nations in the world. But we also learn which editors in the project are contributing most to underrepresented areas, and which are less “tied” to the Western core. Here we see “Wizzy” and “Warofdreams” among the second layer of editors who act as a bridge between the core and the periphery; these are editors with interests in both the Western and marginalised nations. Located along the outer edge, “Gallador” and “Gerrit” have no direct ties to the U.S. or England, concentrating all of their edits on less represented areas of the globe. Identifying editors at these key positions in the network will help with future research, informing interview questions that will investigate their interests further, but more significantly, probing motives for participation and action within the coalition.Additionally, we can break the network down further to discover editors who appear to have similar interests in underrepresented areas. Figure C strips down the network to only editors and edits dealing with Africa and South America, the least represented continents. From this we can easily find three types of editors again: those who have singular interests in particular nations (the outermost layer of editors), those who have interests in a particular region (the second layer moving inward), and those who have interests in both of these underrepresented regions (the center layer in the figure). This last group of editors may prove to be the most crucial to understand, as they are carrying the full load of WP:CSB’s mission.Figure CThe End of Geography, or the Reclamation?In The Internet Galaxy, Manuel Castells writes that “the Internet Age has been hailed as the end of geography,” a bold suggestion, but one that has gained traction over the last 15 years as the excitement for the possibilities offered by information communication technologies has often overshadowed structural barriers to participation like the Digital Divide (207). Castells goes on to amend the “end of geography” thesis by showing how global information flows and regional Internet access rates, while creating a new “map” of the world in many ways, is still closely tied to power structures in the analog world. The Internet Age: “redefines distance but does not cancel geography” (207).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The work of WikiProject: Countering Systemic Bias emphasises the importance of place and representation in the information environment that continues to be constructed in the online world. This study looked at only a small portion of this coalition’s efforts (~16,000 edits)—a snapshot of their labor frozen in time—which itself is only a minute portion of the information being dispatched through Wikipedia on a daily basis (~125,000 edits). Further analysis of WP:CSB’s work over time, as well as qualitative research into the identities, interests and motivations of this collective, is needed to understand more fully how information bias is understood and challenged in the Internet galaxy. The data here indicates this is a fight worth fighting for at least a growing few.ReferencesAlexa. “Top Sites.” Alexa.com, n.d. 10 Mar. 2010 ‹http://www.alexa.com/topsites&amp;gt;.

We follow a mixed-methods approach with descriptive statistics, thematic analysis, and statistical tests to investigate how much discussions in Wikidata are used, what they are used for, and how they support knowledge engineering (KE) activities. The study covers three core sources of discussion, the talk pages that accompany Wikidata items and properties, and a general-purpose communication page. Our findings show low use of discussion capabilities and a power-law distribution similar to other KE projects such as Schema.org. When discussions are used, they are mostly about KE activities, including activities that span across the entire KE lifecycle from conceptualisation and implementation to maintenance and taxonomy building.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Excavating AI: The politics of images in machine learning training sets;,citation_abstract=By looking at the politics of classification within machine learning systems, this article demonstrates why the automated interpretation of images is an inherently social and political project. We begin by asking what work images do in computer vision systems, and what is meant by the claim that computers can “recognize” an image? Next, we look at the method for introducing images into computer systems and look at how taxonomies order the foundational concepts that will determine how a system interprets the world. Then we turn to the question of labeling: how humans tell computers which words will relate to a given image. What is at stake in the way AI systems use these labels to classify humans, including by race, gender, emotions, ability, sexuality, and personality? Finally, we turn to the purposes that computer vision is meant to serve in our society—the judgments, choices, and consequences of providing computers with these capacities. Methodologically, we call this an archeology of datasets: studying the material layers of training images and labels, cataloguing the principles and values by which taxonomies are constructed, and analyzing how these taxonomies create the parameters of intelligibility for an AI system. By doing this, we can critically engage with the underlying politics and values of a system, and analyze which normative patterns of life are assumed, supported, and reproduced.;,citation_author=Kate Crawford;,citation_author=Trevor Paglen;,citation_publication_date=2021-12;,citation_cover_date=2021-12;,citation_year=2021;,citation_fulltext_html_url=https://doi.org/10.1007/s00146-021-01162-8;,citation_issue=4;,citation_doi=10.1007/s00146-021-01162-8;,citation_issn=1435-5655;,citation_volume=36;,citation_journal_title=AI &amp;amp;amp; SOCIETY;">
<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Geographies of Algorithmic Violence: Redlining the Smart City;,citation_abstract=City governments are embracing data-driven and algorithmic planning to tackle urban problems. Data-driven analytics have an unprecedented capacity to call urban futures into being. At the same time, they can depoliticize planning decisions. I argue that this shift calls urban studies scholars to investigate geographies of algorithmic violence—a repetitive and standardized form of violence that contributes to the racialization of space and spatialization of poverty. This article examines this broader phenomenon through the case of a proprietary market value assessment that is being used to guide development in cities across the United States. The assessment employs an algorithm that helps city officials make critical decisions about which neighborhoods to target for investment, disinvestment and public service upgrades or disconnections. I argue that the racial, infrastructural, and epistemological violence associated with this evaluation can potentially lead to a new kind of municipal redlining. The article brings insights from critical race theory into conversation with critical scholarship on algorithms by analyzing how algorithmic violence works through data-driven planning technologies to depoliticize and leverage power while further entrenching racism and inequality.;,citation_author=Sara Safransky;,citation_publication_date=2020;,citation_cover_date=2020;,citation_year=2020;,citation_fulltext_html_url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/1468-2427.12833;,citation_issue=2;,citation_doi=10.1111/1468-2427.12833;,citation_issn=1468-2427;,citation_volume=44;,citation_journal_title=International Journal of Urban and Regional Research;">

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Biometric borders: Governing mobilities in the war on terror;,citation_abstract=This article proposes the concept of the biometric border in order to signal a dual-faced phenomenon in the contemporary war on terror: the turn to scientific technologies and managerial expertise in the politics of border management; and the exercise of biopower such that the bodies of migrants and travellers themselves become sites of multiple encoded boundaries. Drawing on the US VISIT programme of border controls (United States Visitor and Immigrant Status Indicator Technology), the article proposes three central themes of the politics of the biometric border. First, the use of risk profiling as a means of governing mobility within the war on terror, segregating “legitimate” mobilities such as leisure and business, from “illegitimate” mobilities such as terrorism and illegal immigration. Second, the representation of biometrics and the body, such that identity is assumed to be anchored as a source of prediction and prevention. Finally, the techniques of authorization that allow the surveillance of mobility to be practiced by private security firms and homeland security citizens alike. Throughout the article, I argue that, though the biometric border is becoming an almost ubiquitous frontier in the war on terror, it also contains ambivalent, antagonistic and undecidable moments that make it contestable.;,citation_author=Louise Amoore;,citation_publication_date=2006-03;,citation_cover_date=2006-03;,citation_year=2006;,citation_fulltext_html_url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0962629806000217;,citation_issue=3;,citation_doi=10.1016/j.polgeo.2006.02.001;,citation_issn=0962-6298;,citation_volume=25;,citation_journal_title=Political Geography;">
<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Gender Shades: Intersectional Accuracy Disparities in Commercial Gender Classification;,citation_abstract=Recent studies demonstrate that machine learning algorithms can discriminate based on classes like race and gender. In this work, we present an approach to evaluate bias present in automated facial analysis algorithms and datasets with respect to phenotypic subgroups. Using the dermatologist approved Fitzpatrick Skin Type classification system, we characterize the gender and skin type distribution of two facial analysis benchmarks, IJB-A and Adience. We find that these datasets are overwhelmingly composed of lighter-skinned subjects (79.6% for IJB-A and 86.2% for Adience) and introduce a new facial analysis dataset which is balanced by gender and skin type. We evaluate 3 commercial gender classification systems using our dataset and show that darker-skinned females are the most misclassified group (with error rates of up to 34.7%). The maximum error rate for lighter-skinned males is 0.8%. The substantial disparities in the accuracy of classifying darker females, lighter females, darker males, and lighter males in gender classification systems require urgent attention if commercial companies are to build genuinely fair, transparent and accountable facial analysis algorithms.;,citation_author=Joy Buolamwini;,citation_author=Timnit Gebru;,citation_publication_date=2018-01;,citation_cover_date=2018-01;,citation_year=2018;,citation_fulltext_html_url=https://proceedings.mlr.press/v81/buolamwini18a.html;,citation_conference_title=Proceedings of the 1st Conference on Fairness, Accountability and Transparency;,citation_conference=PMLR;">
<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Deep Mediatization;,citation_abstract=Andreas Hepp takes an integrative look at one of the biggest questions in media and communications research: how digital media is changing society. Often, such questions are discussed in isolation, losing sight of the overarching context in which they are situated. Hepp has developed a theory of the re-figuration of society by digital media and their infrastructures, and provides an understanding of how profound today’s media-related changes are, not only for institutions, organizations and communities, but for the individual as well. Rooted in the latest research, this book does not stop at a description of media-related change; instead, it raises the normative challenge of what deep mediatization should look like so that it might just stimulate a ’good life’ for all. Providing original and critical research, the book introduces deep mediatization to students of media and cultural studies, as well as neighboring disciplines like sociology, political science and other cognate disciplines.;,citation_author=Andreas Hepp;,citation_publication_date=2019-12;,citation_cover_date=2019-12;,citation_year=2019;,citation_isbn=978-1-351-06488-0;">
<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Artificial companions, social bots and work bots: Communicative robots as research objects of media and communication studies;,citation_abstract=The aim of this article is to outline “communicative robots” as an increasingly relevant field of media and communication research. Communicative robots are defined as autonomously operating systems designed for the purpose of quasi-communication with human beings to enable further algorithmic-based functionalities – often but not always on the basis of artificial intelligence. Examples of these communicative robots can be seen in the now familiar artificial companions such as Apple’s Siri or Amazon’s Alexa, the social bots present on social media platforms or work bots that automatically generate journalistic content. In all, the article proceeds in three steps. Initially, it takes a closer look at the three examples of artificial companions, social bots and work bots in order to accurately describe the phenomenon and their recent insinuation into everyday life. This will then allow me to grasp the challenges posed by the increasing need to deal with communicative robots in media and communication research. It is from this juncture from where I would like to draw back on the discussion about the automation of communication and clearly outline how communicative robots are more likely than physical artefacts to be experienced at the interface of automated communication and communicative automation.;,citation_author=Andreas Hepp;,citation_publication_date=2020-10;,citation_cover_date=2020-10;,citation_year=2020;,citation_fulltext_html_url=https://doi.org/10.1177/0163443720916412;,citation_issue=7-8;,citation_doi=10.1177/0163443720916412;,citation_issn=0163-4437;,citation_volume=42;,citation_journal_title=Media, Culture &amp;amp;amp; Society;">
<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=The Heart Work of Wikipedia: Gendered, Emotional Labor in the World’s Largest Online Encyclopedia;,citation_abstract=This note explores the issue of women’s participation in Wikipedia through the lens of emotional labor. Using a grounded theory approach, we detail the kinds of tasks women Wikipedians choose to do and explore why they choose the work they do. We also explore the emotional costs of their labor and their strategies for coping. Our analysis of 20 interviews leads us to posit that the gendered and emotional labor required of many women to participate in Wikipedia’s production renders it, problematically, a space of conflicting public and private spheres, motivated by antithetical open and closed values. In addition to other contributions, we believe this insight sheds light on some of the complex dynamics behind Wikipedia’s observed gender gap.;,citation_author=Amanda Menking;,citation_author=Ingrid Erickson;,citation_publication_date=2015-04;,citation_cover_date=2015-04;,citation_year=2015;,citation_fulltext_html_url=https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2702123.2702514;,citation_doi=10.1145/2702123.2702514;,citation_isbn=978-1-4503-3145-6;,citation_conference_title=Proceedings of the 33rd Annual ACM Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems;,citation_conference=Association for Computing Machinery;,citation_series_title=CHI ’15;">

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Women through the glass ceiling: Gender asymmetries in Wikipedia;,citation_abstract=Contributing to the writing of history has never been as easy as it is today thanks to Wikipedia, a community-created encyclopedia that aims to document the world’s knowledge from a neutral point of view. Though everyone can participate it is well known that the editor community has a narrow diversity, with a majority of white male editors. While this participatory gender gap has been studied extensively in the literature, this work sets out to assess potential gender inequalities in Wikipedia articles along different dimensions: notability, topical focus, linguistic bias, structural properties, and meta-data presentation. We find that (i) women in Wikipedia are more notable than men, which we interpret as the outcome of a subtle glass ceiling effect; (ii) family-, gender-, and relationship-related topics are more present in biographies about women; (iii) linguistic bias manifests in Wikipedia since abstract terms tend to be used to describe positive aspects in the biographies of men and negative aspects in the biographies of women; and (iv) there are structural differences in terms of meta-data and hyperlinks, which have consequences for information-seeking activities. While some differences are expected, due to historical and social contexts, other differences are attributable to Wikipedia editors. The implications of such differences are discussed having Wikipedia contribution policies in mind. We hope that the present work will contribute to increased awareness about, first, gender issues in the content of Wikipedia, and second, the different levels on which gender biases can manifest on the Web.;,citation_author=Claudia Wagner;,citation_author=Eduardo Graells-Garrido;,citation_author=David Garcia;,citation_author=Filippo Menczer;,citation_publication_date=2016-12;,citation_cover_date=2016-12;,citation_year=2016;,citation_fulltext_html_url=https://epjdatascience.springeropen.com/articles/10.1140/epjds/s13688-016-0066-4;,citation_issue=1;,citation_doi=10.1140/epjds/s13688-016-0066-4;,citation_issn=2193-1127;,citation_volume=5;,citation_journal_title=EPJ Data Science;">

Gender, Race, and the “Professor Test”;,citation_abstract=This paper documents and estimates the extent of underrepresentation of women and people of color on the pages of Wikipedia devoted to contemporary American sociologists. In contrast to the demographic diversity of the discipline, sociologists represented on Wikipedia are largely white men. The gender and racial/ethnic gaps in likelihood of representation have exhibited little change over time. Using novel data, we estimate the “risk” of having a Wikipedia page for a sample of contemporary sociologists. We show that the observed differences (in academic rank, length of career, and notability measured with both H-index and departmental reputation) between men and women sociologists and whites and nonwhites, respectively, explain only about half of the differences in the likelihood of being represented on Wikipedia.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Care = organisation + physical labour + emotional labour;,citation_abstract=The formula‘care = organisation + physical labour + emotional labour’ identifies component parts of “carework” as they were observed at a hospice. A comparison between women’s domestic carework and that of the hospice nurses is made firstly to clarify the component elements of care and secondly to show how the interrelation and balance of the components differs in the two settings. It is argued that family care has been a model for hospice care but that division of labour in hospices, which replicates hospital labour-divisions, results in an inflexibility in hospice care which is incompatible with the “family” model. In the final section it is suggested that emotional labour is likely to be increasingly recognised as part of health care but that the concept of “total care” needs to be questioned.;,citation_author=Nicky James;,citation_publication_date=1992;,citation_cover_date=1992;,citation_year=1992;,citation_fulltext_html_url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/1467-9566.ep10493127;,citation_issue=4;,citation_doi=10.1111/1467-9566.ep10493127;,citation_issn=1467-9566;,citation_volume=14;,citation_journal_title=Sociology of Health &amp;amp;amp; Illness;">

I argue that by drawing on the ideas of human vulnerability and dependency as central to our personhood, a more realistic conception of selves, citizens and persons can be developed that better recognises the inevitability of human dependency and the social value of care work.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Wage-setting and gender pay equality in Australia: Advances, retreats and future prospects;,citation_abstract=This article re-examines the main principle applied in the pursuit of gender equality in Australian wage-setting systems (equal remuneration for work of equal value) through the lens of a typology of contrasting approaches to gender (and overall) wage equality. It focuses on landmark legislative initiatives and cases over four epochs in Australian wage-setting history, from the first national equal pay case in 1969 to current provisions under the Fair Work Act. Our analysis indicates that there is no guarantee of a progressive trajectory, from narrowly conceived strategies that limit comparisons to the same work, through the revaluation of female-dominated work, to a more comprehensive approach capable of redressing systemic disadvantage. Rather, the Australian pattern has been one of advances, retreats and constantly changing barriers. We argue that although the principle of equal remuneration for work of equal value has potential to challenge the reproduction of gender inequalities within wage-setting systems, this is highly contingent on the strategies in place and ultimately requires recognition that wage disparities reflect the accumulation of structural inequalities and gendered practices.;,citation_author=Meg Smith;,citation_author=Gillian Whitehouse;,citation_publication_date=2020-09;,citation_cover_date=2020-09;,citation_year=2020;,citation_fulltext_html_url=https://doi.org/10.1177/0022185620926220;,citation_issue=4;,citation_doi=10.1177/0022185620926220;,citation_issn=0022-1856;,citation_volume=62;,citation_journal_title=Journal of Industrial Relations;">

Such debates were not new, echoing earlier arguments about honours as a national or imperial symbol. Through two related case studies — the Australian honours system and the Australian of the Year award — this article explores the politics of national recognition in 1970s and 1980s Australia. We consider both the politics involved in the creation and alteration of awards by which individual achievement and service are recognised by the nation, and the politics involved in imagining and recognising an Australian nation as expressed in those awards. We argue that these two institutions were more than a means to acknowledge hard work or sacrifice; they were also significant sites for contests over the nature of Australia’s post-imperial identity.;,citation_author=Karen Fox;,citation_author=Samuel Furphy;,citation_publication_date=2017;,citation_cover_date=2017;,citation_year=2017;,citation_fulltext_html_url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/ajph.12317;,citation_issue=1;,citation_doi=https://doi.org/10.1111/ajph.12317;,citation_issn=1467-8497;,citation_volume=63;,citation_journal_title=Australian Journal of Politics &amp;amp;amp; History;">

We expose seven myths about human annotation, most of which derive from that antiquated ideal of truth, and dispell these myths with examples from our research. We propose a new theory of truth, crowd truth, that is based on the intuition that human interpretation is subjective, and that measuring annotations on the same objects of interpretation (in our examples, sentences) across a crowd will provide a useful representation of their subjectivity and the range of reasonable interpretations.;,citation_author=Lora Aroyo;,citation_author=Chris Welty;,citation_publication_date=2015-03;,citation_cover_date=2015-03;,citation_year=2015;,citation_fulltext_html_url=https://ojs.aaai.org/aimagazine/index.php/aimagazine/article/view/2564;,citation_issue=1;,citation_doi=10.1609/aimag.v36i1.2564;,citation_issn=2371-9621;,citation_volume=36;,citation_journal_title=AI Magazine;">
<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Visual Gender Biases in Wikipedia: A Systematic Evaluation across the Ten Most Spoken Languages;,citation_abstract=Wikipedia, a collaborative crowd-sourced platform, is the largest, most visited online encyclopedia. Since it spreads information freely in more than 300 languages, many users, tools, and dashboards rely on its content. Hence, there is a need to maintain its fairness and completeness. However, previous research has indicated the existence of a significant gender gap in Wikipedia biographical articles. We already know that a minimal proportion of those articles portray women and there are gender asymmetries in the textual content of these articles, but little has been reported about the visual aspects (e.g., image volume or image quality) of the gender gap. Here, we analyze all biographies available on Wikipedia across 300 occupations in the ten most widely spoken languages, and undertake quantitative and qualitative analysis of gender differences in the written and visual content. The cross-lingual results indicate that (1) much of the male bias in content arises when editors select which personalities should have a Wikipedia page, (2) the trends in written and visual content are quite dissimilar, (3) men biographies tend to have more images across languages, and (4) female biographies average better visual quality. A more granular analysis is performed on English Wikipedia, distinguishing trends in occupations and qualitatively analyzing science and technology biographies. The overall results shed light on the kinds of visual biases that emerge in the collaborative creation of Wikipedia and yield guidelines for future management of contributions on the platform.;,citation_author=Pablo Beytía;,citation_author=Pushkal Agarwal;,citation_author=Miriam Redi;,citation_author=Vivek K.

<section id="introduction" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Who counts as Australian in Wikipedia and its sister-projects? How are Wikipedia articles or Wikidata items marked as ‘Australian’ by the system? How does Wikipedia define or represent ‘Australianness’? In this report, we try to address these questions using a dataset of biographical articles culled from English Wikipedia. We have two primary aims: (1) to reveal the definition of ‘Australianess’ implicit in Wikipedia’s systems; (2) to assess how well Wikipedia represents the diversity of Australians. As we will see, Wikipedia works implicitly with numerous inconsistent definitions of ‘Australianness’, but it is nonetheless possible to make some reasonable observations about how well it represents the diversity of people who make up ‘Australia’.</p>
<p>People can be represented in Wikipedia in many ways. They may have an empty article that redirects to another article that concerns them (e.g.&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azaria_Chamberlain">Azaria Chamberlain</a>). They may be mentioned in the text of an article (e.g.&nbsp;Sasha Soldatow or the ‘manual workers’ in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Sydney_Push&amp;oldid=1151477281">Sydney Push</a>). Or they might have a full-blown article devoted to their biography (e.g.&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ada_Cambridge">Ada Cambridge</a>). For the sake of our analysis, we focus on the third kind of representation: the biographical article. This allows us to quantify our analysis, because each article in the dataset equals one person.</p>
<p>We explain how we construct the dataset in <a href="#data">Data</a>. Broadly, we use two methods to identify ‘Australian’ biographies in Wikipedia. First, we use <a href="#wikipedias-category-system">Wikipedia’s category system</a> to find all biographies contained in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Australian_people">Category:Australian people</a>. Second, we use <a href="#wikidatas-query-service">Wikidata’s query service</a> to find all biographies whose corresponding Wikidata item has a property suggestive of ‘Australianness’ (e.g.&nbsp;a <a href="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Property:P9159">People Australia ID</a>). Using these two methods, we identify 83,013 biographies on English Wikipedia that are marked as ‘Australian’ in some way. We enrich these biographies with additional <a href="#metadata">Metadata</a> for further analysis.</p>
<p>Our <a href="#analysis">Analysis</a> of the data unfolds in four main sections. In <a href="#australianness">Australianness</a>, we consider what it means for a person to be ‘Australian’ in Wikipedia. Where does the system draw the line(s) between Australians and non-Australians? We show that the system draws many different lines, which do not always conform with one another. In the subsequent sections of analysis, we consider how Wikipedia captures the diversity of Australia’s people, along the axes of <a href="#gender">Gender</a>, <a href="#indigeneity">Indigeneity</a> and <a href="#historical-period">Historical period</a>. We demonstrate that it is possible to make some generalisations about how Australians are represented in Wikipedia. In particular, we observe considerable normativity in the encyclopaedia: generally, Wikipedia assumes that an ‘Australian’ is a white cisgender male; only if a person departs from this norm are their racial or sexual characteristics explicitly described. While representation of some minority groups may be improving (e.g.&nbsp;the gap between Indigenous and settler Australians), other representation gaps remain tenacious (e.g.&nbsp;the gender gap).</p>
<p>In <a href="#conclusion-beyond-bias">Conclusion: beyond bias</a>, we make some suggestions about how Wikipedians might like to improve the representation of Australians in the encyclopaedia. As well as addressing the traditional problem of ‘systemic bias’, we suggest that Wikipedians draw attention to the <em>representational multiplicity</em> of Wikipedia, so that visitors and editors can become more aware of the multiple definitions of ‘Australianness’ across the Wikiverse.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="wikipedias-category-system">Wikipedia’s category system</h3>
<p>From its inception, Wikipedia has provided a category system to ‘<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Help:Category&amp;oldid=1174603713">group together pages on similar subjects</a>’, and provide useful ‘<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Categorization&amp;oldid=1181497476">navigational links to pages in Wikipedia</a>’. Wikipedia’s categories form a vast and complex tree. A category may contain infintely many subcategories, and those subcategories may themselves belong to infinitely many supercategories. Nearly all Wikipedia articles are categorised, partly due to the work of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_Categories/uncategorized">task group and patrol</a> whose job is to hunt down any uncategorised articles.</p>
<p>In this context, the first place we looked for biographies of Australian people on Wikipedia was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Australian_people">Category:Australian people</a>, which ‘lists notable Australian-born people, or people who identify themselves as Australian’. This category contains 99,626 articles on English Wikipedia, and the number has grown consistently (<a href="#fig-included-in-ozpeople-over-time">Figure&nbsp;1</a>).<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a></p>

<p>Not all the articles in <code>Category:Australian people</code> are biographies. In the first case, there are many articles about groups of Australian people, e.g.&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aboriginal_Victorians">Aboriginal Victorians</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Chamber_Orchestra">Australian Chamber Orchestra</a>. In the second case, <code>Category:Australian people</code> is a vast category, with 9,492 subcategories. In the trackless expanse of these subcategories, some unexpected articles make their way into <code>Category:Australian people</code>, such as the classic glam rock album <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Living_in_the_70%27s"><em>Living in the ’70s</em></a>. We explain the ‘eccentricity’ of the category graph when we analyse Wikipedia’s definition of <a href="#australianness">Australianness</a> below. For now, we simply describe our method for filtering all the non-biographies out of <code>Category:Australian people</code>.</p>
<p>To filter out the non-biographies, we rely on Wikidata. We fetch the Wikidata item for each article in <code>Category:Australian people</code>, and check to see if it has property <a href="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Property:P31">P31</a>(<a href="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5">Q5</a>), ‘instance of:human’. While the possession of P31(Q5) is not a perfect signal that an article is a biography, we find that this criterion filters out nearly all the non-biographies. Applying this criterion, we identify 81,493 biographical articles in <code>Category:Australian people</code>.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="wikidatas-query-service">Wikidata’s query service</h3>
<p>Wikidata provides an alternative method for finding Australian biographies: its <a href="https://query.wikidata.org/">query service</a>. Using the query service, it is possible to search for Wikidata items that possess given properties. If these Wikidata items have a corresponding Wikipedia page, the link can be automatically retrieved.</p>
<p>It is more complex to find the ‘Australians’ in Wikidata than in Wikipedia. Wikipedia provides a single master-category for ‘Australian people’. Wikidata does not. Instead, Wikidata can mark a person as ‘Australian’ in two main ways:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>It can explicitly link a person to Australia (<a href="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q408">Q408</a>) through properties such as citizenship (<a href="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Property:P27">P27</a>), place of birth (<a href="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Property:P19">P19</a>) or place of death (<a href="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Property:P570">P570</a>); or</li>
<li>It can implicitly link a person to Australia by identifying them in a database of Australians, such as the Dictionary of Australian Biography (<a href="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Property:P1907">P1907</a>), Indigenous Australia (<a href="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Property:P9246">P9246</a>), or Convict Records of Australia (<a href="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Property:P9919">P9919</a>)</li>
</ol>
<p>We queried Wikidata by 45 such properties suggesting Australianness. Using these properties, we were able to identify 85,773 Wikidata items representing Australian people. Of these Wikidata items, 63,692 items had a corresponding Wikipedia article.</p>
<p>The two datasets overlap substantially, but not completely (<a href="#fig-biography-overlap-table">Figure&nbsp;2</a>). There are thousands of biographical articles in <code>Category:Australian people</code> whose Wikidata items do not clearly identify them as ‘Australian’. Likewise, there are hundreds of Wikidata items whose corresponding Wikipedia articles do <em>not</em> appear in <code>Category:Australian people</code>, even though the Wikidata item has P31(Q5), ‘instance of:human’, and also contains one or more ‘markers of Australianness’.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="australianness">Australianness</h3>
<p>In this report, we do not seek to define what it means to be ‘Australian’. Instead, we aim to identify the ‘markers of Australianness’ that define what it means to be ‘Australian’ in Wikipedia. We have already introduced these markers in the <a href="#data">Data</a> section. In Wikipedia, the primary marker of Australianness is membership of <code>Category:Australian people</code>. In Wikidata, no marker can be said to be primary, but the most frequent in our dataset is <a href="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Property:P27">P27</a>(<a href="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q408">Q408</a>), a property meaning that a person is a ‘citizen’ of Australia. In both cases, we will see that there is a sharp divide between the way Wikipedians have defined the marker, and they way they have used it.</p>
<p>There are two reasons we refrain from defining ‘Australian’ for ourselves. In the first case, our opinion is not at all important—what matters is Wikipedia’s opinion. In the second case, it is exceptionally difficult to define ‘Australian’ in a non-arbitrary way. In two dimensions, <strong>space</strong> and <strong>time</strong>, the concept of ‘Australian’ poses startling difficulties.</p>
<p>In <strong>space</strong>, it is difficult to judge whether a person is close enough to Australia to count as Australian. At one end of the specturm is someone who is born, lives and dies in Australia, such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oodgeroo_Noonuccal">Oodgeroo Noonuccal</a>. There can be no dispute that such a person is Australian. At the other end of the spectrum is someone who has only a passing cultural or economic connection to Australia, such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Wozniak">Steve Wozniak</a>, one of the more surprising members of <code>Category:Australian people</code>. Then there is the problem of the diaspora. Are the children of Australians Australian, even if born overseas? If, like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rupert_Murdoch">Rupert Murdoch</a>, you leave Australia and renounce your citizenship, do you remain Australian? There may be easy answers to these questions in specific contexts, for example, when calculating a person’s tax liability or entitlement to vote, but in the context of an encyclopaedic project like Wikipedia, they cannot be easily resolved.</p>
<p>In <strong>time</strong>, it is difficult to judge when in history it becomes reasonable to describe someone as ‘Australian’. Humans first arrived in Australia some 60,000 years ago, but they did not call the continent ‘Australia’. The term ‘Terra Australis’ (‘Southern Land’) was coined by 16th-century Europeans. At this time, ‘Terra Australis’ was merely a proposal, as no European had visited either Australia or Antarctica. In the end, neither Australia nor Antarctica matched European expectations about the ‘Southern Land’, though Australia, being the first that Europeans visited, acquired the name. New South Wales was invaded by the British in 1788. The term ‘Australia’ was substituted for ‘Terra Australis’ in 1813. The colonies of Australia federated into a single Commonwealth in 1901. The resulting Commonwealth of Australia only achieved full independence from Britain in 1988. The problem of time is compounded by geology. In the course of Australia’s human occuption, the very landmass has altered considerably. Only 10,000 years ago, the Australian mainland, Papua New Guinea and Tasmania formed a single contiguous landmass that geologers call <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sahul">Sahul</a>. Are all the people who occupied Sahul at any point in time ‘Australians’? Or can only residents or citizens of the country ‘Australia’ be so named? Like space, time wreaks havoc on the category ‘Australian’.</p>
<p>The editors of Wikipedia and Wikidata grapple with both these problems. The result is a kind of categorical anarchy, where different parts of the system work with different concepts of ‘Australianess’ and apply different criteria of connection. It is for this reason that we talk of ‘markers of Australianness’ in Wikipedia. How do these markers work?</p>
<section id="in-the-category-system" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="in-the-category-system">In the category system</h4>
<p>The primary marker of Australianness in Wikipedia, as we have seen, is membership of <code>Category:Australian people</code>. The category offers <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Category:Australian_people&amp;oldid=1148961840">simple criteria for membership</a>:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>This <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Categorization&amp;oldid=1181497476">category</a> lists notable <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia">Australian</a>-born people, or people who identify themselves as Australian.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A user who clicks on the hyperlink ‘Australian’ will be taken to the Wikipedia page for Australia, which defines Australia as follows:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p><strong>Australia</strong>, officially the <strong>Commonwealth of Australia</strong>, is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Sovereign_state&amp;oldid=1182523263">sovereign country</a> comprising the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Mainland_Australia&amp;oldid=1179467610">mainland</a> of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Australia_(continent)&amp;oldid=1182388022">Australian continent</a>, the island of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Tasmania&amp;oldid=1181384565">Tasmania</a>, and numerous <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_islands_of_Australia&amp;oldid=1174981257">smaller islands</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These definitions seem to offer a strong answer to the problems of space and time. ‘Australia’ is the ‘Commonwealth of Australia’, the sovereign state that has existed since 1901. In space, a person must be ‘born’ in Australia, or ‘identify themselves’ as a member of the country. In time, Australia is the Commonwealth of Australia, and so has only existed since 1901.</p>
<p>The problem is, this explicit definition does not at all describe the contents of <code>Category:Australian people</code>. In the spatial dimension, the category includes living people such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Steve_Wozniak&amp;oldid=1182335281">Steve Wozniak</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Darrell_Duffie&amp;oldid=1168175801">Darrell Duffie</a> who were neither born in Australia nor identify themselves with it. In the time dimension, the category includes many historical figures who long predeceased the Commonwealth of Australia, such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Bennelong&amp;oldid=1182881508">Bennelong</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Mary_Reibey&amp;oldid=1182294588">Mary Reiby</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Robert_Lowe&amp;oldid=1176772405">Robert Lowe</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Louisa_Atkinson&amp;oldid=1178386165">Louisa Atkinson</a>. Finally, it lists thousands of entities that aren’t people, such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=First_Ever&amp;oldid=1177339020">First Ever</a>, the sportswear manufacturer, and ‘<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hand_on_Your_Heart&amp;oldid=1181812572">Hand on Your Heart</a>’, the 1989 single by Kylie Minogue. How has <code>Category:Australian people</code> expanded to include so many pages that contradict its own explicit definition?</p>
<p>The answer lies in the category’s size. When editors include articles in <code>Category:Australian people</code>, they do not necessarily do so intentionally. Category:Australian people is the root node of a vast category <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_(discrete_mathematics)">graph</a>. The editor who categorised <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Wozniak">Steve Wozniak</a> as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Academic_staff_of_the_University_of_Technology_Sydney">staff member of the University of Technology Sydney</a> was probably unaware that they were thereby categorising Wozniak as an ‘Australian person’. The category for academic staff at UTS lies several layers deep in the category graph, 4 steps away from the root (<a href="#fig-wozniak-distance-from-oz">Figure&nbsp;3</a>). Perhaps an editor may quibble that a person who works at UTS is not necessarily ‘from Sydney’, but in the present state of the category graph, there is no other way to mark a staff member of UTS. The category graph is strictly hierarchical. A subcategory cannot be removed from its parent category for the sake of a single page.</p>

<figcaption class="figure-caption">Figure&nbsp;3: The category for UTS staff lies four steps away from Category:Australian people</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Category:Australian people has 9,492 subcategories, many of which are even farther from the root than the staff of UTS. We can get a sense of how vast this structure is by taking <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distance_(graph_theory)#Related_concepts">diameter</a> of the category graph. In this case, the diameter is 11, which means that the most distant subcategory of <code>Category:Australian people</code> is 11 steps away. Such distant nodes are called ‘eccentric’ in graph theory. In this case, the most distant subcategory truly is eccentric: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Custard%20(band)%20compilation%20albums">Category:Custard (band) compilation albums</a> does not include articles about ‘Australian people’ at all, but about indie rock records. This case is extreme. The case of UTS staffmembers is more typical. If we consider all the articles that have been placed in <code>Category:Australian people</code> or its subcategories, we find that the subcategories used are on average 3.17 steps away from the root, with a standard deviation of 0.95. In the typical case, when an editor adds an article to an ‘Australian people’ subcategory, the subcategory is 2-4 steps away from the root. It seems likely that editors are mostly unaware of the category graph as a whole. Editors work locally, trying to find the best categorisations for their articles, while Wikipedia’s systems work globally, enforcing the hierarchical logic of the enormous and usually invisible category graph.</p>
<p>There is thus a contradiction between the global and local logics of the category graph. Frequently, the category graph also contradicts the actual content of the encyclopaedia. First Ever is categorised as an ‘Australian person’ even though the text of the article identifies it as ‘<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=First_Ever&amp;oldid=1177339020">an Australian manufacturing company</a>’.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> These contradictions breed a pervasive <em>categorical anarchy</em>. Seen from afar, Wikipedia is extremely lax about who or what counts as ‘Australian’. A person—or even <em>not</em> a person—can be categorised as ‘Australian’ for whatever reason seems reasonable in the local context. Such laxity is probably necessary to Wikipedia’s encyclopaedic ambitions—how else could the vague concept of ‘Australian person’ ever find a place in Wikipedia? Wikidata is a different beast. Rather than a collection of textual articles that can speak for themselves, it is a database of structured facts (called ‘claims’) which are supposed to provide a reliable machine-readable knowledge graph. Can categorical anarchy prevail in such a system?</p>

<section id="in-wikidata" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="in-wikidata">In Wikidata</h4>
<p>Wikidata’s contributors are well aware of the difficulties of space and time. The simplest way to mark someone as ‘Australian’ in Wikidata is to give ‘Australia’ as the person’s ‘country of citizenship’ (<a href="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Property:P27">P27</a>). Our dataset contains 59,259 ‘Australian citizens’ according to P27. A glance at <a href="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Property_talk:P27">the Talk page for P27</a> reveals that Wikidata’s editors are well aware of the problems with trying to categorised people as ‘Australian’ in any stable way.</p>
<p>The user Ghouston clearly clearly articulates the problem of time in a post from 2018:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>It’s not easy. Australian citizenship didn’t exist before 1949, yet Australia as a federation has existed since 1901 and the term “Australian” was in use in the 19th century. To say that the United Kingdom was created in 1927 or the Netherlands perhaps in 1815 or 1945 or China in 1949 is to ignore much of the history of these countries as states.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Two years later, Ghouston provides additional sources and mentions a possible solution:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Separate items for citizenships and nationalities have been proposed previously. Perhaps it would help. The term “Australian” for people living in Australia was already used in the 19th century, before Australia had even been federated as a state, e.g., [<a href="https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/197054485">2</a>]. According to [<a href="https://www.passport-collector.com/evolution-australian-passport/">3</a>], Australia started issuing passports after federation, and didn’t even restrict it to British subjects until 1938, but it seems that passports were not used much prior to WW1, and there was a more flexible attitude to nationality.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>At the time of writing, there is <a href="https://www.wikidata.org/w/index.php?title=Wikidata:Property_proposal/Nationality&amp;oldid=1232071609">no Wikidata property for ‘nationality’</a>. Instead, the property of citizenship is limited according to the ‘inception’ (<a href="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Property:P571">P571</a>) of the given country and the death date of the given person. The start date of Australia is given as <a href="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q408#P571">1 January 1901 in Wikidata</a>. If a person is assigned Australian citizenship in Wikidata, and their death date occurs before 1 January 1901, then a warning appears in their Wikidata page. At the time of writing, <a href="https://www.wikidata.org/w/index.php?title=Q1064745&amp;oldid=1933534532">the Wikidata item for colonial poet Charles Harpur</a> contains such a warning (<a href="#fig-citizenship-warning">Figure&nbsp;4</a>). Harpur, who proudly described himself as as ‘An Australian’ <a href="http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article32148201">in newspaper publications from the 1830s</a>, died in 1868.</p>

<figcaption class="figure-caption">Figure&nbsp;4: Citzenship warning banner for Charles Harpur</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>This solution combines flexibility with clarity.</p>
<ul>
<li>Flexibility: It is possible to mark the ‘Australianness’ of Charles Harpur and others who have been identified as Australian throughout history.</li>
<li>Clarity: Wikidata provides clear guidance to its contributors through the warning banner. As far as Wikidata is concerned, Australian citizenship was available to people from 1901.</li>
</ul>
<p>The price of this clarity and flexibility is inconsistency and quixotism.</p>
<ul>
<li>Inconsistency: Wikidata flatly contradicts itself as far as historical figures like Charles Harpur are concerned. Was Harpur a citizen of Australia or not? Wikidata also contradicts, or at least brings into question, its own definition of ‘citizenship’. Wikidata defines citizenship (P27) thus: ‘<a href="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Property:P27">the object is a country that recognizes the subject as its citizen</a>’ This definition is not reflected in P27’s rules: all that is required is that the country exists prior to the supposed citizen’s birth date. If Harpur were posthumously recognised as a citizen by the Commonwealth of Australia, this could not currently be reflected in the database. The warning banner would remain.</li>
<li>Quixotism: As Ghouston himself observes, Australia did not have an official system for conferring citizenship until 1949. By seeming to choose 1 January 1901 as earliest permitted date, Wikidata has invented its own concept of Australian citizenship. Is this quixotism consistent with Wikidata’s self-description as a ‘<a href="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:Introduction">secondary database, collecting structured data</a>’? Does Wikidata collect structured data, or does it structure collected data?</li>
</ul>
<p>Wikimedians are aware of the difficulty of time. The state of P27 suggests that they are content for the minute to leave the difficulty unresolved.</p>
<p>The difficulty of space is less clearly articulated on the talk page for P27 (‘country of citizenship’). Perhaps this is because the concept ‘citizenship’ presupposes a deep and publicly sanctioned connection between the person and the country. In a sense, Wikidata delegates the question of a person’s spatial connection to Australia, by recording when a person appears in a known database of Australians. These databases make their own decisions about the ‘Australianness’ of their subjects. The Dictionary of Australian Biography, for example, does not required its subjects to be Australian at all, as explained <a href="https://adb.anu.edu.au/faqs/#aussie">in their FAQs</a>:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p><strong>Do you have to be an Australian to be in the ADB?</strong><br>
The ADB includes anyone who has made a significant contribution to the Australian nation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The AusStage database, meanwhile, <a href="https://www.ausstage.edu.au/pages/learn/data-scope">records any person who ‘contributed’ in some way to a theatrical performance in Australia, or to an overseas performance of an Australian theatrical work</a>. AusStage and the Australian Dictionary of Biography provide very broad markers of Australianness. By contrast, the <a href="https://www.parliament.vic.gov.au/about/people-in-parliament/re-member/form/27">Re-Member database of the Parliament of Victoria</a> provides a stricter marker of a person’s Australianness. To appear in Re-Member, a person must be a former member of the Parliament of Victoria. We identified dozens of other databases that indicated ‘Australianess’ in Wikidata. When a Wikimedian links a person to the Australian Dictionary of Biography (<a href="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Property:P1907">P1907</a>), AusStage (<a href="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Property:P8292">P8292</a>), Re-Member (<a href="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Property:P8633">P8633</a>), or some other database of Australians, the linked database will encode a different answer to the question ‘Who Counts as Australian?’</p>
<p>This raises the question: how do these different properties overlap in Wikidata? Are there some markers of Australianness that tend to go together? Are there others that exclude each other? For example, we might assume that if a person is linked to the Convict Records of Australia database (<a href="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Property:P9919">P9919</a>), they should not usually have Australia as their place of birth, since the great majority of convicts were transported from Britain and Ireland, rather than between the colonies.</p>
<p>To explore the connection between different markers of Australianness, we generated a correlation plot between the 20 most common Wikidata properties of the 45 that we queried (<a href="#fig-wikidata-property-matrix">Figure&nbsp;5</a>). A red square indicates a positive correlation between two Wikidata properties: for example, a person with an <a href="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Property:P1907">Australian Dictionary of Biography ID</a> (<code>aus_dictionary_bio</code>) is highly likely also to have a <a href="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Property:P9159">People Australia ID</a> (<code>people_of_aus</code>). A blue square indicates a negative correlation between two properties: for example, a person marked as a citizen of Australia is highly unlikely to have been assigned an <a href="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Property:P3546">AustralianFootball.com ID</a> (<code>aus_football</code>).</p>

<figcaption class="figure-caption">Figure&nbsp;5: Few of the properties are strongly correlated</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Only a few of the properties are correlated, and there are only a couple of strong correlations in the matrix.</p>
<p>Many of the strong correlations reflect relationships between the databases on which Wikidata relies for information. For example, it is not surprising to see a strong correlation between Australian Dictionary of Biography ID (<code>aus_dictionary_bio</code>), Labour Australia ID (<code>labour_of_aus</code>), People Australia ID (<code>people_of_aus</code>) and Obituaries of Australia ID (<code>obit_of_aus</code>). These four databases are all run by the National Centre for Biography at the Australian National University, and are tightly interconnected. Every person in Obituaries Australia, Labour Australia or the ADB automatically receives a People Australia ID.</p>
<p>Other strong correlations represent a similarity of subject-matter. For instance, three Wikidata properties link to databases of Australian artists (<code>nat_gallery_vic_artist</code>, <code>aus_printmakers</code>, <code>design_and_art_aus</code>). A person who has an ID in one of these external databases is likely to have an ID available in the others. Similar explanations apply to sporting databases (<code>atheltics_aus</code> and <code>aus_olympics</code>) and newspaper databases (<code>obit_of_aus</code>).</p>
<p>Overall, the lack of correlation between the properties reflects the heterogeneous nature of Wikidata. It is a vast and exceptionally flexible database, and it is possible for different communities of contributors to build up data in quite unrelated areas. This is illustrated nowhere better than in the negative correlation between AustralianFootball.com ID and the other Wikidata properties. Fans of Australian Rules Football have painstakingly entered data about hundreds of professional footballers into Wikidata, without troubling to mark these records with other properties such as Trove ID or citizenship of Australia. The shape of Wikidata could easily change if another committed group of editors decided to document their own subculture in the database. ‘Australian’ is an extremely uneven and inconsistent idea in Wikidata.</p>

<section id="gender" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="gender">Gender</h3>
<p>Although it is impossible to provide a unitary definition for ‘Australian’ in Wikidata and Wikipedia, we have shown that it is possible to derive a large list of people who are marked as ‘Australian’ in some way across the encyclopaedia and database. What is the composition of this list? We first consider the gendered composition of the dataset, before turning to the representation of <a href="#indigeneity">Indigenous Australians and Torres Strait Islander peoples</a> in the next section.</p>
<p>To determine the gender of a person in our dataset, we rely on the Wikidata property <a href="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Property:P21">P21:Sex or gender</a>. In our dataset, nearly all records have a sex or gender recorded (<a href="#fig-genders-in-dataset">Figure&nbsp;6</a>). Only 2,065 records lack a <code>P21</code> statement about their sex or gender.</p>

<p><span class="citation" data-cites="weathington_queer_2023">Weathington and Brubaker (<a href="#ref-weathington_queer_2023" role="doc-biblioref">2023</a>)</span> have strongly critiqued Wikidata’s representation of sex and gender, observing that “Queer identities are recorded in a database in clunky, inaccurate, or self-contradictory ways” [p.&nbsp;2] and that the database ignores the individual’s right to determine their own sexual presentation. Nonetheless, we are compelled to rely on Wikidata’s representation of individuals’ sex and/or gender if we wish to assess its representation of human diversity in Australia. To this end, we categorise our dataset into three broad groups: <code>Male</code>, <code>Female</code> and <code>Trans, Non-Binary or Intersex</code>. While we may assume that most of those marked as ‘male’ or ‘female’ are <em>cis</em>-male or -female, we cannot determine this from the available data, and so opt for the less specific ‘male’ and ‘female’.</p>
<p><code>Female</code> biographies are clearly under-represented among Wikipedia’s Australian articles. (<a href="#fig-genders-in-dataset">Figure&nbsp;6</a>) shows all Wikipedia biographies that appear in <code>Category:Australian people</code>, or whose Wikidata item contains a marker of Australianness, categories by gender. The gap between <code>Male</code> and <code>Female</code> biographies appears to have remained constant over time (<a href="#fig-gender-by-page-creation">Figure&nbsp;7</a>). Viewing the data on a logarithmic scale emphasise the parallel track of <code>Male</code> and <code>Female</code> biographies in Australian Wikipedia, while also allowing us to visualise the similar growth of <code>Trans, Non-Binary or Intersex</code> biographies (<a href="#fig-gender-by-page-creation-log">Figure&nbsp;8</a>).</p>

<p>Not only are male, female and LGBTQI+ Australians represented in different numbers in the encyclopaedia, they are represented by different words. To show this, we downloaded the introductions of each article in the encyclopaedia, and used the tf-idf statistic to determine which words were most distinctive for each group of biographies. Which words tend to appear more often in the introductions of articles about <code>Male</code>, <code>Female</code> and <code>Trans, Non-Binary and Intersex</code> Australians?</p>

</figure>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p><a href="#fig-intro-words-by-gender">Figure&nbsp;9</a> discloses two significant patterns:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Explicit marking of non-Male genders</em>: First, Wikipedia articles are more likely to explicitly mention the sex or gender of a <code>Female</code> or <code>Trans, Non-Binary or Intersex</code> Australian. The high tf-idf score for “women’s” in biographies of Females probably reflects the fact that female sporting teams are often have “women’s” in their names. Thus Sam Kerr is said to represent Australian in the “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Sam_Kerr&amp;oldid=1174642959">national women’s team</a>”, while Harry Kewell was simply a member of “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Harry_Kewell&amp;oldid=1177164031">the Australian national team</a>”. The situation for <code>Trans, Non-Binary and Intersex</code> Australians is even more marked. ‘Transgender’, ‘sex’ and ‘woman’ all appear as distinctive terms in the introductions of Wikipedia biographies in this group.</li>
<li><em>Dominance of sport and entertainment</em>: Across all three gender categories, sport and entertainment are dominant themes. The <code>Male</code> biographies seem less likely to describe entertainers than those in the other categories. Unsuprisingly, the <code>Trans, Non-Binary and Intersex</code> biographies seem more likely to discuss social affairs, ‘activist’ and ‘rights’ being prominent terms in the introductions of these biographies.</li>
</ul>
<p>The data support the views of <span class="citation" data-cites="weathington_queer_2023">Weathington and Brubaker (<a href="#ref-weathington_queer_2023" role="doc-biblioref">2023</a>)</span>. In Australian Wikipedia, maleness is the unmarked default. <code>Female</code> and especially <code>Trans, Non-Binary and Intersex</code> Australians are described using terms such as ‘women’ or ‘transgender’; there is no need to explicitly mention that a person is male or cisgender. In the case of <code>Trans, Non-Binary and Intersex</code> people, this explicit marking of gender goes a step further. Australians in this group are likely to be described as ‘activists’, presumbly on gender issues. Biographies of <code>Trans, Non-Binary and Intersex</code> Australians problematise gender in a manner that biographies of of <code>Male</code> Australians do not.</p>
<p>Wikipedia’s defaulting to malenes probably reflects the linguistic habits of broader Australian society, but it could also be exacerbated by the encylopaedia’s obsession with sport and entertainment. Both sport and entertainment are highly gendered fields. Men and women compete in gendered competitions such as the soccer or cricket World Cups and receive gendered commendations such as Best Actress at the Academy Awards. While <code>Male</code> Australians may dominate non-<code>Male</code> Australians in fields such as politics, business and the arts, these fields are no so explicitly gendered. Sam Kerr may indeed be captain of the “women’s national team,” but it makes no sense to describe <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vanessa_Hudson_(executive)">Vanessa Hudson</a> as the CEO of a “women’s corporation.” Sport and entertainment are fields that reflect society’s deepest-held and most immoveable convictions. Wikipedia’s powerful focus on these fields may place the encyclopaedia behind other parts of Australia in the evolution of non-gendered language.</p>
<p>Finally in this section, we consider the attention received by biographies in these three groups. Which Australians are the focus of editor activity, and which are of most interest to readers? We used the XTools API to download page usage statistics for articles in each group. <a href="#fig-assessment-data-by-gender">Figure&nbsp;10</a> gives a snapshot of this information.</p>

<figcaption class="figure-caption">Figure&nbsp;10: Editors and readers of Wikipedia appear to have different priorities when it comes to gender</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
</div>
<p><a href="#fig-assessment-data-by-gender">Figure&nbsp;10</a> reveals a stark contrast between readers and editors of the encylopaedia. Editors spend roughly equal effort on the <code>Male</code> and <code>Female</code> biographies. The number of revisions for each biography, the number of editors, and the time elapsed since last edit are all similar. The result is that Wikipedia’s editors expend a roughly 4 times the effort maintaining <code>Male</code> biographies on Wikipedia than <code>Female</code> ones. Readers of the encyclopaedia, however, have different priorities. Although view biographies of <code>Male</code> Australians more often than <code>Female</code>, an individual <code>Female</code> biography can expect to be viewed roughly 1.6 times more often than any given biography of a <code>Male</code> Australian.</p>
<p>Biographies of <code>Trans, Non-Binary or Intersex</code> Australians, meanwhile, receive a great deal of attention from both editors and readers compared to biographies in the other groups. Given there are only 69 biographies in this group, the numbers are difficult to compare. Editors probably pay extra attention to these pages because they are more prone to vandalism by internet trolls. There would likely be subsets of the <code>Male</code> and <code>Female</code> pages at risk of similar vandalism, which would have a similar pageview and edit profile. It is nonetheless sadly predictable that biographies of <code>Trans, Non-Binary or Intersex</code> Australians should have such high page activity on Wikipedia today.</p>
<p>In conclusion, it seems that the gender gap on Australian Wikipedia is wide, and is not currently narrowing. Despite the under-representation of women in the encyclopaedia, editors appear to devote equal attentions both to <code>Male</code> and <code>Female</code> biographies. The number of non-cisgender biographies appears to be very small—though it is possible that many non-cisgender Australians have fallen into the <code>Male</code> and <code>Female</code> groups in our analysis due to the crude categorisation method. This small group of non-cisgender biographies receieve a great deal of attention. The most likely reason would appear to be vandalism, though we have not investigated this hypothesis. Wikipedia appears to reflect aspects of Australian gender culture, though the gender gap is probably inflated by the encyclopaedia’s strong focus on sport and entertainment, which are highly gendered even by comparison to other fields of social endeavour. This gender gap is reflected in the encyclopaedia’s language as well as in the sheer number of articles and editors’ activities upon them. It appears likely that Wikipedia is behind Australian society generally in its representation of women, given that biographies of <code>Female</code> Australians are so much more likely to be viewed than <code>Male</code> biographies. If more <code>Female</code> Australians were represented in the encylopaedia, would this ratio change? If the number of <code>Male</code> and <code>Female</code> articles were equal, would readers still prefer to read <code>Female</code> Australians’ biographies, or would their average interest decline as the total increased? At this point, we can only speculate.</p>

<section id="indigeneity" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="indigeneity">Indigeneity</h3>
<p>The distinction between ‘settler’ and ‘indigenous’ Australian pervades Wikipedia in a cryptic way. Race and ethncity are portrayed in a lopsided manner in Wikipedia, much like gender. In English Wikipedia, <span class="citation" data-cites="mandiberg_wikipedias_2023">Mandiberg (<a href="#ref-mandiberg_wikipedias_2023" role="doc-biblioref">2023</a>)</span> observes, people are not officially classified by ‘race’, but whiteness is assumed as a default, and a person is far more likely to be categorised by their ethnic or national origin if they are non-white.</p>
<p>There is no explicit category for ‘settler’ or ‘white’ Australian. There are categories for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Immigrants_to_Australia">Category:Immigrants to Australia</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Australian_people_of_European_descent">Category:Australian people of European Descent</a>, but these are applied only haphazardly to indicate the ‘settler’ status of a minority of Australians. A good example is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Tony_Abbott&amp;oldid=1178396384">Tony Abbott</a>. According to his Wikipedia biography, he was born in London to English parents, and ‘migrated to Australia at the age of two’. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Tony_Abbott&amp;action=info">His page is nearly 20 years old, and has been edited more than 4000 times.</a>. Nonetheless, no-one has thought to categorise him either as an ‘immigrant’ or as an Australian ‘of European descent’. Extending Mandiberg’s arguments, we can hypothesise that ‘settler’ status is assumed in Australian Wikipedia, and a person’s whiteness or migrant status is considered unremarkable if they are British. We substantiate this hypothesis below.</p>
<p>There may be no single category for ‘settler’ or ‘white’ Australian, but there is certainly a single overarching category for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Category:Indigenous_Australian_people&amp;oldid=971541573">Indigenous Australian people</a>. Within this category, editors are instructed to sub-categorise Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians as precisely as possible (<a href="#fig-template-catdiffuse-indig-aus">Figure&nbsp;11</a>). These subcategories fall into three main kinds:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Sub-categories for mob or language group, e.g.&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Category:Pitjantjatjara_people&amp;oldid=1141634439">Category:Pitjantjatjara people</a>.</li>
<li>Sub-categories for occupation, e.g.&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Category:Indigenous_Australian_linguists&amp;oldid=1139800186">Category:Indigenous Australian linguists</a> (Curiously, neither <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Category:Australian_Aboriginal_guides&amp;action=info">guide</a> nor <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Category:Australian_Aboriginal_trackers&amp;oldid=1141656309">tracker</a> is considered an occupation in this scheme.)</li>
<li>Miscellaneous subcategories, including <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Category:Members_of_the_Stolen_Generations&amp;oldid=825612121">Category:Members of the Stolen Generations</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Category:Last_known_speakers_of_an_Australian_Aboriginal_language&amp;oldid=951554350">Category:Last known speakers of an Aboriginal language</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Indigenous_Australian_feminists">Category:Indigenous Australian feminists</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Category:Australian_Aboriginal_elders&amp;oldid=940594168">Category:Australian Aboriginal elders</a>.</li>

<p><code>Category:Indigenous Australian people</code> is actually nested quite deeply within the Australian category graph (<a href="#fig-ethnic-categorisation-graph">Figure&nbsp;12</a>). <a href="#fig-ethnic-categorisation-graph">Figure&nbsp;12</a> may at first be confusing to Australian readers, because it is common in Australia to refer to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people as “First Nations Australians.” In English Wikipedia’s category graph, however, the term “First Nations” is used <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Nations_in_Canada">the Canadian sense</a>.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> In this instance, Wikipedia’s category graph is potentially incendiary, because it appears to imply there is no special connection between Indigenous Australians and the continent to which they are indigenous. The overarching <code>Category:Australian people by ethnic or national origin</code> is organised predominantly by continent or region. There are sub-categories for Australians of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Australian_people_of_African_descent">African</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Australian_people_of_Asian_descent">Asian</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Australian_people_of_Caribbean_descent">Carribean</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Australian_people_of_Latin_American_descent">Latin American</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Australian_people_of_Middle_Eastern_descent">Middle Eastern</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Australian_people_of_North_American_descent">North American</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Australian_people_of_Oceanian_descent">Oceanian</a> descent. There is no category for “Australians of Australian descent”, nor is <code>Category:Australian people of Indigenous Australian descent</code> included as a subcategory of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Category:Australian_people_of_Oceanian_descent&amp;oldid=607565632"><code>Category:Australian people of Oceanian descent</code></a>.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> By contrast, <code>Category:Australians of First Nations descent</code> is included as a subcategory of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Category:Australian_people_of_Canadian_descent&amp;oldid=649754186"><code>Category:Australian people of Canadian descent</code></a>, which is itself a subcategory of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Category:Australian_people_of_North_American_descent&amp;oldid=839030224"><code>Category:Australians of North American descent</code></a>. In this local portion of the graph, the link between First Nations Canadians and Canada is formally encoded. The link between Indigenous Australian people and Australia is not. A naïve reader of the graph (such as a computer program) might erroneously conclude that <code>First Nations</code> Australians have the same relationship to Australia as <code>Indigenous</code> Australians.</p>

<p>In Wikipedia’s defence, the indigeneity of Indigenous Australians is encoded in other ways. In this local portion of the graph, a human can see from the <em>labels</em> of <code>Category:Australian people of Indigenous Australian descent</code> and <code>Category:Indigenous Australian people</code> that people in these categories are indigenous <em>to Australia</em>. Looking beyond this local portion of the graph, we can also see that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Indigenous_peoples_of_Australia"><code>Category:Indigenous peoples of Australia</code></a> is a subcategory of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Indigenous_peoples_of_Oceania"><code>Category:Indigenous peoples of Oceania</code></a>. It is nonetheless curious that the local portion of the graph that classifies Australians by ‘ethnic or national origin’ should de-emphasise <code>Category:Indigenous Australian people</code>.</p>
<p>The situation is different for other countries in English Wikipedia. Other settler-colonial countries include categories for their own indigenous peoples directly beneath the super-category for <code>people by ethnic or national origin</code>. For example, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Category:Indigenous_Mexicans&amp;oldid=887057212">Category:Indigenous Mexicans</a> is a direct subcategory of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Category:Mexican_people_by_ethnic_or_national_origin&amp;oldid=645962797">Category:Mexican people by ethnic or national origin</a>, while the analogous Australian category, <code>Category:Indigenous Australian people</code>, is two steps deeper in the graph. A similar pattern holds for other settler-colonial states. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:New_Zealand_people_by_ethnic_or_national_origin">New Zealand</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:New_Caledonian_people_by_ethnic_or_national_origin">New Caledonia</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:South_African_people_by_ethnic_or_national_origin">South Africa</a> and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:American_people_by_ethnic_or_national_origin">United States</a> all include top-level categories for their Indigenous peoples under the <code>people by ethnic or national origin</code> super-category.</p>
<p>There is a second notable difference between the category graphs for Australia and Mexico. We have seen that Australia’s <code>Category:Australian people of indigenous peoples descent</code> is used to classify people who are indigenous anywhere. The analogous Mexican category, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Category:Mexican_people_of_indigenous_peoples_descent&amp;oldid=812065156"><code>Category:Mexican people of indigenous peoples descent</code></a>, is used exclusively to classify indigenous peoples of Mexico itself. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Brazilian_people_by_ethnic_or_national_origin">Brazil</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Brazilian_people_by_ethnic_or_national_origin">Argentina</a> similarly reserve their ‘indigenous peoples’ category for their own indigenous peoples.</p>
<p>Australia is not entirely alone. The subgraph for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Japanese_people_by_ethnic_or_national_origin"><code>Category:Japanese people by ethnic or national origin</code></a> also obfuscates the indigeneity of Japan’s indigenous peoples. There is no explicit category for Japanese people ‘of indigenous descent’. Instead, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Japanese_Ainu_people"><code>Category:Japanese Ainu people</code></a> is included as a subcategory of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Japanese_people_of_East_Asian_descent"><code>Category:Japanese people of East Asian descent</code></a>. In this way, the link between Ainu people and the region is locally marked in the category graph, but one must look elsewhere in the graph to discover that Ainu people are <em>indigenous</em> to Japan.</p>
<p>It is clear that quantifying indigenous representation in Wikipedia is a fraught exercise. Scholars are well advised to carefully consider how indigeneity is understood in different parts of the world, and then to pay close attention to the particular structure of ethnic and national classification in any particular part of Wikipedia.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, we can use the category graph to estimate the number of biographies of Indigenous Australians in Wikipedia. <a href="#fig-indigenous-growth-wikipedia">Figure&nbsp;13</a> suggests that in recent years, Wikipedians may have begun to address the representation gap between Indigenous and settler Australians. <a href="#fig-indigenous-growth-wikipedia">Figure&nbsp;13</a> shows the proportaion of biographies under <code>Category:Australian people of Indigenous Australian descent</code> as a proportion of all biographies in <code>Category:Australian people</code>. The representation gap for Indigenous Australians is not so stark as the representation gap for non-male Australians. According to the Australian Census, the number of Indigenous Australians <a href="https://www.abs.gov.au/statistics/people/people-and-communities/snapshot-australia/2021#aboriginal-and-torres-strait-islander-communities">grew from 2.5% of Australia’s population to 3.2% between 2011 and 2021.</a>. In our estimate, the proportion of Indigenous biographies in <code>Category:Australian people</code>, went from 2.35% on January 1 2011 to 2.09% on January 1 2021. At the time of our data collection, the proportion had risen again to 2.21%. Although comparison with the census would suggest that Wikipedia under-represents Indigenous Australians, the representation gap is currently narrowing.</p>

<ol type="1">
<li>A person’s ‘description’ may mention their indigeneity. For example, <a href="https://www.wikidata.org/w/index.php?title=Q817828&amp;oldid=1617736683">Bennelong</a> is described as an ‘Eora interlocutor with the British in Australia and the United Kingdom’. To obtain an estimate of Indigenous Australians in the Wikidata data, we have used the crude method of seraching for known keywords, including ‘indigneous’, ‘aboriginal’ and ‘eora’, then scanning the results by eye to exclude false positives (for example <a href="">Judith Wright</a>, who is described as an ‘Indigenous rights activist’ on Wikidata). <strong>TODO: Kelly, I think we need to do this again using the additional 18000 records from Category:Australian People</strong></li>
<li>A person may be linked to a record in the <a href="https://ia.anu.edu.au/">Indigenous Australia</a> database (<a href="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Property:P9246">P9246</a>). At the time of writing, the Indigenous Australia database contains <a href="https://ia.anu.edu.au/biographies/name/">973 entries</a> for Indigenous Australians. Of these 973, 304 have been linked to a Wikidata item.</li>

<li id="fn1"><p>The growth was calculated using the <code>timestamp</code> data returned by <a href="https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/API:Categorymembers">API:Categorymembers</a>. The <code>timestamp</code> records when an article, file or subcategory was included in a given category. The documentation does not explain how the inclusion time is calculated for pages that are removed from and then re-included in a category. If an article was included in multiple subcategories of Category:Australian people, then the earliest timestamp was used to calculate its position in the figure.<a href="#fnref1" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn2"><p>In this case, the article falls under <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Category:Clothing_brands_of_Australia&amp;oldid=938233678">Category:Clothing brands of Australia</a>, which is a distant subcategory of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Category:Australian_designers&amp;oldid=921932361">Category:Australian designers</a>, which is then linked through a number of other categories to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Category:Australian_people&amp;oldid=1148961840">Category:Australian people</a>.<a href="#fnref2" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn3"><p>This has the notable corollary that there are no categories in Wikipedia for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C3%A9tis">Métis</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inuit">Inuit</a> Australians.<a href="#fnref3" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn4"><p>In other parts of English Wikipedia, Australia is included as part of Oceania.
